Animation
î‚±
Methods
Since 4.0.0
stretch()
V4
JS
Changes the total duration of an animation and its tweens duration to fit a specific time.
The total duration is equal to the duration of an iteration multiplied with the total number of iterations. So if an animation is 1000ms and loops twice (3 iterations in total), the total duration will be 3000ms (1000 * 3).
animation.
stretch
(duration);
Parameters
Name
Type
Description
duration
Number
The new total duration in ms of the animation
Stretching an animation to
0
will also set all its tweens' durations to
0
, which will make them all the same length on subsequent calls to
stretch
()
.
Returns
The animation itself
Can be chained with other animation methods.
