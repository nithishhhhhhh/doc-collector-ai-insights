CSS Properties
Any CSS numerical and color properties can be animated.
Properties containing a dash in their name, like
background-color
, must be converted to camel case (
backgroundColor
), or written as a
String
(
'background-color'
).
Most CSS properties can cause layout changes or repaint leading to choppy animations. To achieve smoother animations, always prioritise opacity and
CSS transforms
as much as possible.
