Timeline
î‚±
Methods
Since 4.0.0
init()
V4
Initialises the initial values of all the elements of a timeline.
Animations with specific initial values added to a timeline are not automatically set to their
from
state like a normal call to
animate
()
would, instead, they are initialised when the timeline playhead reaches the element in the timeline.
This is where
.
init
()
comes in handy, it forces a render of all the children initial state and updates their values.
Returns
The timeline itself
Can be chained with other timeline methods.
