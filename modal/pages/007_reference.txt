API Reference
This is the API reference for the
modal
Python package, which allows you to run distributed applications on Modal.
The reference is intended to be limited to low-level descriptions of various
programmatic functionality. If youâ€™re just getting started with Modal, we would
instead recommend looking at the
guide
first
or to get started quickly with an
example
Application construction
The main unit of deployment for code on Modal
App.function
Decorator for registering a function with an App
App.cls
Decorator for registering a class with an App
Serverless execution
Function
A serverless function backed by an autoscaling container pool
A serverless class supporting parametrization and lifecycle hooks
Extended Function configuration
Class parametrization
parameter
Used to define class parameters, akin to a Dataclass field
Lifecycle hooks
enter
Decorator for a method that will be executed during container startup
exit
Decorator for a method that will be executed during container shutdown
method
Decorator for exposing a method as an invokable function
Web integrations
fastapi_endpoint
Decorator for exposing a simple FastAPI-based endpoint
asgi_app
Decorator for functions that construct an ASGI web application
wsgi_app
Decorator for functions that construct a WSGI web application
web_server
Decorator for functions that construct an HTTP web server
Function semantics
batched
Decorator that enables
dynamic input batching
concurrent
Decorator that enables
input concurrency
Scheduling
Cron
A schedule that runs based on cron syntax
Period
A schedule that runs at a fixed interval
Exception handling
Retries
Function retry policy for input failures
Sandboxed execution
Sandbox
An interface for restricted code execution
ContainerProcess
An object representing a sandboxed process
FileIO
A handle for a file in the Sandbox filesystem
Container configuration
Image
An API for specifying container images
Secret
A pointer to secrets that will be exposed as environment variables
Data primitives
Persistent storage
Volume
Distributed storage supporting highly performant parallel reads
CloudBucketMount
Storage backed by a third-party cloud bucket (S3, etc.)
NetworkFileSystem
Shared, writeable cloud storage (superseded by
modal.Volume
In-memory storage
Dict
A distributed key-value store
Queue
A distributed FIFO queue
Networking
Proxy
An object that provides a static outbound IP address for containers
forward
A context manager for publicly exposing a port from a container
