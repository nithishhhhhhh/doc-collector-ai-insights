TFrameX Core Concepts
Understanding the fundamental building blocks of the TFrameX framework.
TFrameX is built around several key concepts that work together to create powerful AI applications. Expand each section below to learn more about these core components.
Agents
The intelligent actors in TFrameX, capable of reasoning, using tools, and interacting. They are the workhorses of your AI applications.
Tools
Functions that grant agents external capabilities, like API access, database queries, or custom computations.
Flows & FlowContext
Orchestrate sequences of agent actions and pattern executions to achieve complex goals.
Interaction Patterns
Pre-defined, reusable structures for common multi-agent collaborations and task processing logic within Flows.
LLM Integration
Pluggable wrappers for Large Language Models, making TFrameX adaptable to various LLM providers and local setups.
Memory Management
Enabling agents to recall past interactions and maintain context throughout conversations or tasks.
MCP Integration
Connect TFrameX agents to external services and capabilities using the Multi-Capability Protocol.
Agent-as-Tool (Hierarchical Agents)
A powerful paradigm where 'supervisor' agents can delegate tasks to 'specialist' agents by calling them like tools.
Messages
The primary data structure for communication between users, agents, and tools.
