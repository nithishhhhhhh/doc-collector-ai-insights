TFrameX: Orchestrate Intelligence
The Extensible Python Framework for Building Advanced, Multi-Agent LLM Applications with Sophisticated Flow Control and Tool Integration.
Explore Core Concepts
Quick Start Guide
What is TFrameX?
Unlocking the potential of collaborative AI agents.
TFrameX is a Python library meticulously designed by Tesslate to empower developers in building, orchestrating, and managing complex applications driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a robust and extensible foundation for creating systems where multiple AI agents can collaborate, utilize tools, follow intricate workflows, and adapt to dynamic tasks.
The core philosophy behind TFrameX is to offer a structured yet highly flexible approach to agentic AI development. It moves beyond simple prompt-chaining, enabling you to define sophisticated interactions, manage state, and integrate diverse capabilities into cohesive, intelligent systems.
Why TFrameX? The Advantage.
Sophisticated Agent Definition
Craft specialized agents with unique personas (system prompts), dedicated LLMs, specific toolsets, and independent memory stores. Tailor each agent precisely for its role.
Seamless & Extensible Tooling
Effortlessly integrate Python functions as tools for your agents using a simple decorator. TFrameX handles schema generation, enabling agents to interact with APIs, databases, or any custom logic.
Advanced Flow Orchestration
Design intricate workflows using the 'Flow' concept. Chain agents and powerful 'Patterns' (Sequential, Parallel, Router, Discussion) to control the logic and data progression in your applications.
Powerful Interaction Patterns
Utilize pre-built patterns for common multi-agent collaborations like debates, parallel task processing, and conditional routing, simplifying the design of complex interactions.
Agent-as-Tool Paradigm
A cornerstone of TFrameX: enable 'supervisor' agents to call other 'specialist' agents as tools. This facilitates hierarchical task decomposition and advanced delegation.
Flexible LLM & Memory Backend
Start with OpenAI-compatible LLMs (including local servers like Ollama) and InMemoryMemory. Extend to custom LLM wrappers and persistent memory stores as needed.
Who is TFrameX For?
AI Application Developers:
Building complex chatbots, AI assistants, or automated systems requiring multiple LLM interactions.
Researchers:
Exploring multi-agent systems, collaborative AI, and advanced LLM reasoning patterns.
Enterprise Teams:
Looking to integrate sophisticated AI automation into existing workflows and systems.
Hobbyists & Innovators:
Experimenting with the cutting edge of LLM capabilities and agentic design.
"TFrameX is built on the principle that the next generation of AI applications will be powered by a symphony of specialized agents working in concert. We provide the conductor's baton." - Tesslate
