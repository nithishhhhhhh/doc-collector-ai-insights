Download the source code and working demo for this guide from the
twbs/examples repository
. You can also
open the example in StackBlitz
but not run it because Parcel isn’t currently supported there.
What is Parcel?
Parcel
is a web application bundler designed to simplify the development process with a zero-configuration setup out of the box. It offers features found in more advanced bundlers while focusing on ease of use, making it ideal for developers seeking a quick start.
Setup
We’re building a Parcel project with Bootstrap from scratch, so there are some prerequisites and upfront steps before we can really get started. This guide requires you to have Node.js installed and some familiarity with the terminal.
Create a project folder and set up npm.
We'll create the
my-project
folder and initialize npm with the
argument to avoid it asking us all the interactive questions.
mkdir
my-project
my-project
init
Install Parcel.
Unlike our Webpack guide, there’s only a single build tool dependency here. Parcel will automatically install language transformers (like Sass) as it detects them. We use
--save-dev
to signal that this dependency is only for development use and not for production.
i --save-dev parcel
Install Bootstrap.
Now we can install Bootstrap. We'll also install Popper since our dropdowns, popovers, and tooltips depend on it for their positioning. If you don’t plan on using those components, you can omit Popper here.
--save
Now that we have all the necessary dependencies installed, we can get to work creating the project files and importing Bootstrap.
Project structure
We’ve already created the
my-project
folder and initialized npm. Now we'll also create our
folder, stylesheet, and JavaScript file to round out the project structure. Run the following from
my-project
, or manually create the folder and file structure shown below.
mkdir
src,src/js,src/scss
touch
src/index.html src/js/main.js src/scss/styles.scss
When you’re done, your complete project should look like this:
my-project/
├── src/
│   ├── js/
│   │   └── main.js
│   ├── scss/
│   │   └── styles.scss
│   └── index.html
├── package-lock.json
└── package.json
At this point, everything is in the right place, but Parcel needs an HTML page and npm script to start our server.
Configure Parcel
With dependencies installed and our project folder ready for us to start coding, we can now configure Parcel and run our project locally. Parcel itself requires no configuration file by design, but we do need an npm script and an HTML file to start our server.
Fill in the
src/index.html
file.
Parcel needs a page to render, so we use our
index.html
page to set up some basic HTML, including our CSS and JavaScript files.
doctype
html

lang
head
meta

Hello, Bootstrap and Parcel!
button
class
btn btn-primary
Primary button
button
body
html
We’re including a little bit of Bootstrap styling here with the
div class="container"
<button>
so that we see when Bootstrap’s CSS is loaded by Parcel.
Parcel will automatically detect we’re using Sass and install the
Sass Parcel plugin
to support it. However, if you wish, you can also manually run
npm i --save-dev @parcel/transformer-sass
Add the Parcel npm scripts.
Open the
package.json
and add the following
start
script to the
scripts
object. We'll use this script to start our Parcel development server and render the HTML file we created after it’s compiled into the
dist
directory.
// ...
"scripts"
"start"
"parcel serve src/index.html --public-url / --dist-dir dist"
"test"
"echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
// ...
And finally, we can start Parcel.
From the
my-project
folder in your terminal, run that newly added npm script:
start
In the next and final section to this guide, we'll import all of Bootstrap’s CSS and JavaScript.
Import Bootstrap
Importing Bootstrap into Parcel requires two imports, one into our
styles.scss
and one into our
main.js
Import Bootstrap’s CSS.
Add the following to
src/scss/styles.scss
to import all of Bootstrap’s source Sass.
// Import all of Bootstrap’s CSS
@import
"bootstrap/scss/bootstrap"
You can also import our stylesheets individually if you want.
Read our Sass import docs
for details.
Optional:
You may see Sass deprecation warnings with the latest versions of Dart Sass. These can silenced by adding the following configuration in a
.sassrc.js
file in the root folder with the following:
module
exports
silenceDeprecations
'import'
'mixed-decls'
'color-functions'
'global-builtin'
Import Bootstrap’s JS.
Add the following to
src/js/main.js
to import all of Bootstrap’s JS. Popper will be imported automatically through Bootstrap.
// Import all of Bootstrap’s JS
import
from
'bootstrap'
You can also import JavaScript plugins individually as needed to keep bundle sizes down:
import
Alert
from
'bootstrap/js/dist/alert'
// or, specify which plugins you need:
import
Tooltip
Toast
Popover
from
'bootstrap'
Read our JavaScript docs
for more information on how to use Bootstrap’s plugins.
And you’re done! 🎉
With Bootstrap’s source Sass and JS fully loaded, your local development server should now look like this:
Now you can start adding any Bootstrap components you want to use. Be sure to
check out the complete Parcel example project
for how to include additional custom Sass and optimize your build by importing only the parts of Bootstrap’s CSS and JS that you need.
