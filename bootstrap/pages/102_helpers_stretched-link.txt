==================================================

.stretched-link
to a link to make its
containing block
clickable via a
::after
pseudo element. In most cases, this means that an element with
position: relative;
that contains a link with the
.stretched-link
class is clickable. Please note given
how CSS
position
works
.stretched-link
cannot be mixed with most table elements.
Cards have
position: relative
by default in Bootstrap, so in this case you can safely add the
.stretched-link
class to a link in the card without any other HTML changes.
Multiple links and tap targets are not recommended with stretched links. However, some
position
z-index
styles can help should this be required.

Most custom components do not have
position: relative
by default, so we need to add the
.position-relative
here to prevent the link from stretching outside the parent element.

Identifying the containing block
If the stretched link doesn’t seem to work, the
containing block
will probably be the cause. The following CSS properties will make an element the containing block:
position
value other than
static
transform
perspective
value other than
none
will-change
value of
transform
perspective
filter
value other than
none
or a
will-change
value of
filter
(only works on Firefox)

This
