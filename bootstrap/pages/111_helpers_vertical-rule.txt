==================================================

How it works
Vertical rules are inspired by the
<hr>
element, allowing you to create vertical dividers in common layouts. They’re styled just like
<hr>
elements:
They’re
wide
They have
min-height
Their color is set via
currentColor
opacity
Customize them with additional styles as needed.
Example
html
class
Vertical rules scale their height in flex layouts:
html
class
d-flex
style
height
200px

With stacks
They can also be used in
stacks
