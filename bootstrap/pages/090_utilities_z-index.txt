Example
z-index
utilities to stack elements on top of one another. Requires a
position
value other than
static
, which can be set with custom styles or using our
position utilities
We call these “low-level”
z-index
utilities because of their default values of
through
, which we use for the layout of overlapping components. High-level
z-index
values are used for overlay components like modals and tooltips.

Overlays
z-index
values to ensure a usable experience with competing “layers” of an interface.
Read about them in the
z-index
layout page
Component approach
On some components, we use our low-level
z-index
values to manage repeating elements that overlap one another (like buttons in a button group or items in a list group).

z-index
approach
