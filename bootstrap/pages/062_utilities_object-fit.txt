==================================================

How it works
Change the value of the
object-fit
property
with our responsive
object-fit
utility classes. This property tells the content to fill the parent container in a variety of ways, such as preserving the aspect ratio or stretching to take up as much space as possible.
Classes for the value of
object-fit
are named using the format
.object-fit-{value}
. Choose from the following values:
contain
cover
fill
scale
(for scale-down)
none
Examples
Add the
object-fit-{value}
class to the
replaced element
html
class
object-fit-contain border rounded
class
object-fit-cover border rounded
class
object-fit-fill border rounded
class
object-fit-scale border rounded
class
object-fit-none border rounded
Responsive
Responsive variations also exist for each
object-fit
value using the format
.object-fit-{breakpoint}-{value}
, for the following breakpoint abbreviations:
