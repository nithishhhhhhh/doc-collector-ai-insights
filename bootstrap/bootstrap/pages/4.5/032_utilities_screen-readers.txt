Screen readers
Use screen reader utilities to hide elements on all devices except screen readers.
Hide an element to all devices
except screen readers
with
.sr-only
. Combine
.sr-only
with
.sr-only-focusable
to show the element again when itâ€™s focused (e.g. by a keyboard-only user). Can also be used as mixins.
class=
"sr-only sr-only-focusable"
href=
"#content"
</a>
// Usage as a mixin
.skip-navigation
