Overflow
Use these shorthand utilities for quickly configuring how content overflows an element.
Barebones
overflow
functionality is provided for two values by default, and they are not responsive.
This is an example of using
.overflow-auto
on an element with set width and height dimensions. By design, this content will vertically scroll.
This is an example of using
.overflow-hidden
on an element with set width and height dimensions.
<div
class=
"overflow-auto"
</div>
<div
class=
"overflow-hidden"
</div>
Using Sass variables, you may customize the overflow utilities by changing the
$overflows
variable in
_variables.scss
