Accessibility
A brief overview of Bootstrap’s features and limitations for the creation of accessible content.
Overview and Limitations
The overall accessibility of any project built with Bootstrap depends in large part on the author’s markup, additional styling, and scripting they’ve included. However, provided that these have been implemented correctly, it should be perfectly possible to create websites and applications with Bootstrap that fulfill
WCAG
(A/AA/AAA),
Section 508
and similar accessibility standards and requirements.
Structural markup
Interactive components
ARIA
roles and attributes, these components should also be understandable and operable using assistive technologies (such as screen readers).
Because Bootstrap’s components are purposely designed to be fairly generic, authors may need to include further
ARIA
roles and attributes, as well as JavaScript behavior, to more accurately convey the precise nature and functionality of their component. This is usually noted in the documentation.
Color contrast
Most colors that currently make up Bootstrap’s default palette—used throughout the framework for things such as button variations, alert variations, form validation indicators—lead to
insufficient
color contrast (below the recommended
WCAG 2.0 color contrast ratio of 4.5:1
) when used against a light background. Authors will need to manually modify/extend these default colors to ensure adequate color contrast ratios.
Visually hidden content
Content which should be visually hidden, but remain accessible to assistive technologies such as screen readers, can be styled using the
.sr-only
class. This can be useful in situations where additional visual information or cues (such as meaning denoted through the use of color) need to also be conveyed to non-visual users.
class=
"text-danger"
<span
class=
"sr-only"
Danger:
</span>
This action is not reversible
</p>
For visually hidden interactive controls, such as traditional “skip” links,
.sr-only
can be combined with the
.sr-only-focusable
class. This will ensure that the control becomes visible once focused (for sighted keyboard users).
class=
"sr-only sr-only-focusable"
href=
"#content"
</a>
Reduced motion
prefers-reduced-motion
media feature
. In browsers/environments that allow the user to specify their preference for reduced motion, most CSS transition effects in Bootstrap (for instance, when a modal dialog is opened or closed) will be disabled. Currently, support is limited to Safari on macOS and iOS.
