Spacing
How it works
Assign responsive-friendly
margin
padding
values to an element or a subset of its sides with shorthand classes. Includes support for individual properties, all properties, and vertical and horizontal properties. Classes are built from a default Sass map ranging from
.25rem
3rem
Notation
Spacing utilities that apply to all breakpoints, from
, have no breakpoint abbreviation in them. This is because those classes are applied from
min-width: 0
and up, and thus are not bound by a media query. The remaining breakpoints, however, do include a breakpoint abbreviation.
The classes are named using the format
{property}{sides}-{size}
{property}{sides}-{breakpoint}-{size}
, and
Where
property
is one of:
- for classes that set
margin
- for classes that set
padding
Where
sides
is one of:
- for classes that set
margin-top
padding-top
- for classes that set
margin-bottom
padding-bottom
- for classes that set
margin-left
padding-left
- for classes that set
margin-right
padding-right
- for classes that set both
*-left
*-right
- for classes that set both
*-top
*-bottom
blank - for classes that set a
margin
padding
on all 4 sides of the element
Where
size
is one of:
- for classes that eliminate the
margin
padding
by setting it to
- (by default) for classes that set the
margin
padding
$spacer * .25
- (by default) for classes that set the
margin
padding
$spacer * .5
- (by default) for classes that set the
margin
padding
$spacer
- (by default) for classes that set the
margin
padding
$spacer * 1.5
- (by default) for classes that set the
margin
padding
$spacer * 3
auto
- for classes that set the
margin
to auto
(You can add more sizes by adding entries to the
$spacers
Sass map variable.)
Examples
Here are some representative examples of these classes:
.mt-0
margin-top
important
.ml-1
margin-left
$spacer
important
.px-2
padding-left
$spacer
important
padding-right
$spacer
important
.p-3
padding
$spacer

Horizontal centering
Additionally, Bootstrap also includes an
.mx-auto
class for horizontally centering fixed-width block level content—that is, content that has
display: block
and a
width
set—by setting the horizontal margins to
auto
Centered element
<div
class=
"mx-auto"
style=
"width: 200px;"
Centered element
</div>
