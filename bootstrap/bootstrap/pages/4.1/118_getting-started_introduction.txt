Introduction
Get started with Bootstrap, the world’s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites, with jsDelivr and a template starter page.
Quick start
Looking to quickly add Bootstrap to your project? Use jsDelivr, provided for free by the folks at jsDelivr. Using a package manager or need to download the source files?
Head to the downloads page.
Copy-paste the stylesheet
<link>
into your
<head>
before all other stylesheets to load our CSS.
<link
rel=
"stylesheet"
href=
"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
integrity=
"sha384-MCw98/SFnGE8fJT3GXwEOngsV7Zt27NXFoaoApmYm81iuXoPkFOJwJ8ERdknLPMO"
crossorigin=
"anonymous"
Many of our components require the use of JavaScript to function. Specifically, they require
jQuery
Popper.js
, and our own JavaScript plugins. Place the following
<script>
s near the end of your pages, right before the closing
</body>
tag, to enable them. jQuery must come first, then Popper.js, and then our JavaScript plugins.
We use
jQuery’s slim build
, but the full version is also supported.
<script
src=
"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"
integrity=
"sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo"

Curious which components explicitly require jQuery, our JS, and Popper.js? Click the show components link below. If you’re at all unsure about the general page structure, keep reading for an example page template.
include
Popper
, but not
jQuery
. For more information about what’s included in Bootstrap, please see our
contents
section.
Show components requiring JavaScript
Alerts for dismissing
Buttons for toggling states and checkbox/radio functionality
Carousel for all slide behaviors, controls, and indicators
Collapse for toggling visibility of content
Dropdowns for displaying and positioning (also requires
Popper.js
Modals for displaying, positioning, and scroll behavior
Navbar for extending our Collapse plugin to implement responsive behavior
Tooltips and popovers for displaying and positioning (also requires
Popper.js
Scrollspy for scroll behavior and navigation updates
Starter template
Be sure to have your pages set up with the latest design and development standards. That means using an HTML5 doctype and including a viewport meta tag for proper responsive behaviors. Put it all together and your pages should look like this:
<!doctype html>
<html
lang=
"en"
<head>
<!-- Required meta tags -->
<meta
charset=
"utf-8"
<meta
name=
"viewport"
content=
"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"
<!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
<link
rel=
"stylesheet"
href=
"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
integrity=
"sha384-MCw98/SFnGE8fJT3GXwEOngsV7Zt27NXFoaoApmYm81iuXoPkFOJwJ8ERdknLPMO"
crossorigin=

<title>
Hello, world!
</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>
Hello, world!
</h1>
<!-- Optional JavaScript -->
<!-- jQuery first, then Popper.js, then Bootstrap JS -->
<script
src=
"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"

Important globals
normalization
of cross browser styles. Let’s dive in.
HTML5 doctype
<!doctype html>
<html
lang=
"en"
</html>
Responsive meta tag
mobile first
, a strategy in which we optimize code for mobile devices first and then scale up components as necessary using CSS media queries. To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming for all devices,
add the responsive viewport meta tag
to your
<head>
<meta
name=
"viewport"
content=
"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"
You can see an example of this in action in the
starter template
Box-sizing
For more straightforward sizing in CSS, we switch the global
box-sizing
value from
content-box
border-box
. This ensures
padding
does not affect the final computed width of an element, but it can cause problems with some third party software like Google Maps and Google Custom Search Engine.
On the rare occasion you need to override it, use something like the following:
.selector-for-some-widget
box-sizing
content-box
With the above snippet, nested elements—including generated content via
::before
::after
—will all inherit the specified
box-sizing
for that
.selector-for-some-widget

box model and sizing at CSS Tricks
Reboot
For improved cross-browser rendering, we use
Reboot
to correct inconsistencies across browsers and devices while providing slightly more opinionated resets to common HTML elements.
