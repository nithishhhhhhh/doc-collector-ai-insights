Introduction
Get started with Bootstrap, the world’s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites, with jsDelivr and a template starter page.
Quick start
Looking to quickly add Bootstrap to your project? Use jsDelivr, a free open source CDN. Using a package manager or need to download the source files?
Head to the downloads page
Copy-paste the stylesheet
<link>
into your
<head>
before all other stylesheets to load our CSS.
link
"stylesheet"
href
"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"

Many of our components require the use of JavaScript to function. Specifically, they require
jQuery
Popper
, and our own JavaScript plugins. We use
jQuery’s slim build
, but the full version is also supported.
Place
one of the following
<script>
near the end of your pages, right before the closing
</body>
tag, to enable them. jQuery must come first, then Popper, and then our JavaScript plugins.
Bundle
Include every Bootstrap JavaScript plugin with one of our two bundles. Both
include
Popper
for our tooltips and popovers, but not
jQuery
. Include jQuery first, then a Bootstrap JavaScript bundle. For more information about what’s included in Bootstrap, please see our
contents
section.

Separate
If you decide to go with the separate scripts solution, Popper must come first (if you’re using tooltips or popovers), and then our JavaScript plugins.

Components
Curious which components explicitly require jQuery, our JavaScript, and Popper? Click the show components link below. If you’re unsure about the page structure, keep reading for an example page template.
Show components requiring JavaScript
Alerts for dismissing
Buttons for toggling states and checkbox/radio functionality
Carousel for all slide behaviors, controls, and indicators
Collapse for toggling visibility of content
Dropdowns for displaying and positioning (also requires
Popper
Modals for displaying, positioning, and scroll behavior
Navbar for extending our Collapse plugin to implement responsive behavior
Scrollspy for scroll behavior and navigation updates
Tooltips and popovers for displaying and positioning (also requires
Popper
Starter template
Be sure to have your pages set up with the latest design and development standards. That means using an HTML5 doctype and including a viewport meta tag for proper responsive behaviors. Put it all together and your pages should look like this:
<!doctype html>
html
lang
"en"
head
<!-- Required meta tags -->
meta
charset
"utf-8"
meta
name
"viewport"
content
"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"
<!-- Bootstrap CSS -->

Responsive meta tag
mobile first
, a strategy in which we optimize code for mobile devices first and then scale up components as necessary using CSS media queries. To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming for all devices,
add the responsive viewport meta tag
to your
<head>
meta
name
"viewport"
content
"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"
You can see an example of this in action in the
starter template
Box-sizing
For more straightforward sizing in CSS, we switch the global
box-sizing
value from
content-box
border-box
. This ensures
padding
does not affect the final computed width of an element, but it can cause problems with some third party software like Google Maps and Google Custom Search Engine.
On the rare occasion you need to override it, use something like the following:
selector-for-some-widget
box-sizing
content-box
With the above snippet, nested elements—including generated content via
::before
::after
—will all inherit the specified
box-sizing
for that
.selector-for-some-widget

box model and sizing at CSS Tricks
Reboot
For improved cross-browser rendering, we use
Reboot
to correct inconsistencies across browsers and devices while providing slightly more opinionated resets to common HTML elements.

CSPs and embedded SVGs
Several Bootstrap components include embedded SVGs in our CSS to style components consistently and easily across browsers and devices.
For organizations with more strict
configurations
, we’ve documented all instances of our embedded SVGs (all of which are applied via
background-image
) so you can more thoroughly review your options.
Close button
(used in alerts and modals)
Custom checkboxes and radio buttons
Form switches
Form validation icons
Custom select menus
Carousel controls
Navbar toggle buttons
Based on
community conversation
, some options for addressing this in your own codebase include replacing the URLs with locally hosted assets, removing the images and using inline images (not possible in all components), and modifying your CSP. Our recommendation is to carefully review your own security policies and decide on a best path forward, if necessary.
