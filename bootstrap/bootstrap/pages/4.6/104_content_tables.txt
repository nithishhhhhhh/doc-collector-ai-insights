Tables
Documentation and examples for opt-in styling of tables (given their prevalent use in JavaScript plugins) with Bootstrap.
Examples
Due to the widespread use of tables across third-party widgets like calendars and date pickers, we’ve designed our tables to be
opt-in
. Just add the base class
.table
to any
<table>
, then extend with custom styles or our various included modifier classes.
Using the most basic table markup, here’s how
.table
-based tables look in Bootstrap.
All table styles are inherited in Bootstrap 4
, meaning any nested tables will be styled in the same manner as the parent.

Conveying meaning to assistive technologies
Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies – such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the
.sr-only
class.
Create responsive tables by wrapping any
.table
with
.table-responsive{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl}
, making the table scroll horizontally at each
max-width
breakpoint of up to (but not including) 576px, 768px, 992px, and 1120px, respectively.
Note that since browsers do not currently support
range context queries
, we work around the limitations of
min-
max-
prefixes
and viewports with fractional widths (which can occur under certain conditions on high-dpi devices, for instance) by using values with higher precision for these comparisons.
Captions
<caption>
functions like a heading for a table. It helps users with screen readers to find a table and understand what it’s about and decide if they want to read it.

Responsive tables
Responsive tables allow tables to be scrolled horizontally with ease. Make any table responsive across all viewports by wrapping a
.table
with
.table-responsive
. Or, pick a maximum breakpoint with which to have a responsive table up to by using
.table-responsive{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl}
Vertical clipping/truncation
Responsive tables make use of
overflow-y: hidden
, which clips off any content that goes beyond the bottom or top edges of the table. In particular, this can clip off dropdown menus and other third-party widgets.
Always responsive
Across every breakpoint, use
.table-responsive
for horizontally scrolling tables.

Breakpoint specific
.table-responsive{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl}
as needed to create responsive tables up to a particular breakpoint. From that breakpoint and up, the table will behave normally and not scroll horizontally.
These tables may appear broken until their responsive styles apply at specific viewport widths.
