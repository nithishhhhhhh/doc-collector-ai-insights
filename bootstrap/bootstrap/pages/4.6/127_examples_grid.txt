==================================================

Basic grid layouts to get you familiar with building within the Bootstrap grid system.
In these examples the
.themed-grid-col
class is added to the columns to add some theming. This is not a class that is available in Bootstrap by default.
Five grid tiers
There are five tiers to the Bootstrap grid system, one for each range of devices we support. Each tier starts at a minimum viewport size and automatically applies to the larger devices unless overridden.

Three equal columns
Get three equal-width columns
starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops
. On mobile devices, tablets and below, the columns will automatically stack.
.col-md-4
.col-md-4
.col-md-4
Three unequal columns
Get three columns
starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops
of various widths. Remember, grid columns should add up to twelve for a single horizontal block. More than that, and columns start stacking no matter the viewport.
.col-md-3
.col-md-6
.col-md-3
Two columns
Get two columns
starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops
.col-md-8
.col-md-4
Full width, single column
No grid classes are necessary for full-width elements.
Two columns with two nested columns
Per the documentation, nesting is easyâ€”just put a row of columns within an existing column. This gives you two columns
starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops
, with another two (equal widths) within the larger column.
At mobile device sizes, tablets and down, these columns and their nested columns will stack.
.col-md-8
.col-md-6
.col-md-6
.col-md-4
Mixed: mobile and desktop
The Bootstrap v4 grid system has five tiers of classes: xs (extra small, this class infix is not used), sm (small), md (medium), lg (large), and xl (extra large). You can use nearly any combination of these classes to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.
Each tier of classes scales up, meaning if you plan on setting the same widths for md, lg and xl, you only need to specify md.
