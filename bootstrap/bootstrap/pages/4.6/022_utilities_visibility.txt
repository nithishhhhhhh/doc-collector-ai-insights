Visibility
Control the visibility, without modifying the display, of elements with visibility utilities.
Set the
visibility
of elements with our visibility utilities. These utility classes do not modify the
display
value at all and do not affect layout â€“
.invisible
elements still take up space in the page. Content will be hidden both visually and for assistive technology/screen reader users.
Apply
.visible
.invisible
as needed.
