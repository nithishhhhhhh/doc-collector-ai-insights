Text
Documentation and examples for common text utilities to control alignment, wrapping, weight, and more.
Text alignment
Easily realign text to components with text alignment classes.
Some placeholder text to demonstrate justified text alignment. Will you do the same for me? It's time to face the music I'm no longer your muse. Heard it's beautiful, be the judge and my girls gonna take a vote. I can feel a phoenix inside of me. Heaven is jealous of our love, angels are crying from up above. Yeah, you take me to utopia.

Text wrapping and overflow
Wrap text with a

class.
This text should wrap.
class
"badge badge-primary text-wrap"
style
"width: 6rem;"
This text should wrap.
Prevent text from wrapping with a
.text-nowrap
class.
This text should overflow the parent.
class
"text-nowrap bd-highlight"
style
"width: 8rem;"
This text should overflow the parent.
For longer content, you can add a
.text-truncate
class to truncate the text with an ellipsis.
Requires
display: inline-block
display: block
Praeterea iter est quasdam res quas ex communi.
Praeterea iter est quasdam res quas ex communi.

Word break
Prevent long strings of text from breaking your components’ layout by using
.text-break
to set
word-wrap: break-word
word-break: break-word
. We use
word-wrap
instead of the more common
overflow-wrap
for wider browser support, and add the deprecated
word-break: break-word
to avoid issues with flex containers.
