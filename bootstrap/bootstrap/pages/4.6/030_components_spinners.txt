Spinners
Indicate the loading state of a component or page with Bootstrap spinners, built entirely with HTML, CSS, and no JavaScript.
About
For accessibility purposes, each loader here includes
role="status"
and a nested
<span class="sr-only">Loading...</span>
The animation effect of this component is dependent on the
prefers-reduced-motion
media query. See the
reduced motion section of our accessibility documentation
Border spinner
Use the border spinners for a lightweight loading indicator.

Colors
The border spinner uses
currentColor
for its
border-color
, meaning you can customize the color with
text color utilities
. You can use any of our text color utilities on the standard spinner.

Why not use
border-color
utilities?
Each border spinner specifies a
transparent
border for at least one side, so
.border-{color}
utilities would override that.
Growing spinner
If you don’t fancy a border spinner, switch to the grow spinner. While it doesn’t technically spin, it does repeatedly grow!

"status"

"sr-only"

Once again, this spinner is built with
currentColor
, so you can easily change its appearance with
text color utilities
. Here it is in blue, along with the supported variants.

Alignment
Spinners in Bootstrap are built with
currentColor
, and
display: inline-flex
. This means they can easily be resized, recolored, and quickly aligned.
Margin
margin utilities
like
.m-5
for easy spacing.
