Carousel
A slideshow component for cycling through elements—images or slides of text—like a carousel.
How it works
The carousel is a slideshow for cycling through a series of content, built with CSS 3D transforms and a bit of JavaScript. It works with a series of images, text, or custom markup. It also includes support for previous/next controls and indicators.
In browsers where the
Page Visibility API
is supported, the carousel will avoid sliding when the webpage is not visible to the user (such as when the browser tab is inactive, the browser window is minimized, etc.).
The animation effect of this component is dependent on the
prefers-reduced-motion
media query. See the
reduced motion section of our accessibility documentation
Please be aware that nested carousels are not supported, and carousels are generally not compliant with accessibility standards.
Lastly, if you’re building our JavaScript from source, it
requires
util.js
Example
Carousels don’t automatically normalize slide dimensions. As such, you may need to use additional utilities or custom styles to appropriately size content. While carousels support previous/next controls and indicators, they’re not explicitly required. Add and customize as you see fit.
.active
class needs to be added to one of the slides
otherwise the carousel will not be visible. Also be sure to set a unique
on the
.carousel
for optional controls, especially if you’re using multiple carousels on a single page. Control and indicator elements must have a
data-target
attribute (or
href
for links) that matches the
of the
.carousel
element.
Slides only
Here’s a carousel with slides only. Note the presence of the
.d-block
.w-100
on carousel images to prevent browser default image alignment.

With captions
Add captions to your slides easily with the
.carousel-caption
element within any
.carousel-item
. They can be easily hidden on smaller viewports, as shown below, with optional
display utilities
. We hide them initially with
.d-none
and bring them back on medium-sized devices with
.d-md-block

Crossfade
.carousel-fade
to your carousel to animate slides with a fade transition instead of a slide. Depending on your carousel content (e.g., text only slides), you may want to add
.bg-body
or some custom CSS to the
.carousel-item
s for proper crossfading.

Disable touch swiping
Carousels support swiping left/right on touchscreen devices to move between slides. This can be disabled using the
data-touch
attribute. The example below also does not include the
data-ride
attribute and has
data-interval="false"
so it doesn’t autoplay.

Usage
Via data attributes
Use data attributes to easily control the position of the carousel.
data-slide
accepts the keywords
prev
next
, which alters the slide position relative to its current position. Alternatively, use
data-slide-to
to pass a raw slide index to the carousel
data-slide-to="2"
, which shifts the slide position to a particular index beginning with
data-ride="carousel"
attribute is used to mark a carousel as animating starting at page load. If you don’t use
data-ride="carousel"
to initialize your carousel, you have to initialize it yourself.
It cannot be used in combination with (redundant and unnecessary) explicit JavaScript initialization of the same carousel.
Via JavaScript
Call carousel manually with:
'.carousel'
carousel
Options
Options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to
data-
, as in
data-interval=""
Name
Type
Default
Description
interval
number
5000
The amount of time to delay between automatically cycling an item. If
false
, carousel will not automatically cycle.
keyboard
boolean
true
Whether the carousel should react to keyboard events.
pause
string | boolean
'hover'
If set to
'hover'
, pauses the cycling of the carousel on
mouseenter
and resumes the cycling of the carousel on
mouseleave
. If set to
false
, hovering over the carousel won't pause it.
On touch-enabled devices, when set to
'hover'
, cycling will pause on
touchend
(once the user finished interacting with the carousel) for two intervals, before automatically resuming. Note that this is in addition to the above mouse behavior.
ride
string
false
Autoplays the carousel after the user manually cycles the first item. If set to
'carousel'
, autoplays the carousel on load.
wrap
boolean
true
Whether the carousel should cycle continuously or have hard stops.
touch
boolean
true
Whether the carousel should support left/right swipe interactions on touchscreen devices.
Methods
Asynchronous methods and transitions
All API methods are
asynchronous
and start a
transition
. They return to the caller as soon as the transition is started but
before it ends
. In addition, a method call on a
transitioning component will be ignored
See our JavaScript documentation for more information
.carousel(options)
Initializes the carousel with an optional options
object
and starts cycling through items.
'.carousel'
carousel
interval
2000
.carousel('cycle')
Cycles through the carousel items from left to right.
.carousel('pause')
Stops the carousel from cycling through items.
.carousel(number)
Cycles the carousel to a particular frame (0 based, similar to an array).
Returns to the caller before the target item has been shown
(i.e. before the
slid.bs.carousel
event occurs).
.carousel('prev')
Cycles to the previous item.
Returns to the caller before the previous item has been shown
(i.e. before the
slid.bs.carousel
event occurs).
.carousel('next')
Cycles to the next item.
Returns to the caller before the next item has been shown
(i.e. before the
slid.bs.carousel
event occurs).
.carousel('dispose')
Destroys an element’s carousel.
.carousel('nextWhenVisible')
Don’t cycle the carousel to next when the page isn’t visible or the carousel or its parent isn’t visible.
Returns to the caller before the next item has been shown
(i.e. before the
slid.bs.carousel
event occurs).
.carousel('to')
Cycles the carousel to a particular frame (0 based, similar to an array).
Returns to the caller before the next item has been shown
(i.e. before the
slid.bs.carousel
event occurs).
Events
direction
: The direction in which the carousel is sliding (either
"left"
"right"
relatedTarget
: The DOM element that is being slid into place as the active item.
from
: The index of the current item
: The index of the next item
All carousel events are fired at the carousel itself (i.e. at the
<div class="carousel">
Event Type
Description
slide.bs.carousel
This event fires immediately when the
slide
instance method is invoked.
slid.bs.carousel
This event is fired when the carousel has completed its slide transition.
'#myCarousel'
'slide.bs.carousel'
function
// do something...
Change transition duration
The transition duration of
.carousel-item
can be changed with the
$carousel-transition
Sass variable before compiling or custom styles if you’re using the compiled CSS. If multiple transitions are applied, make sure the transform transition is defined first (eg.
transition: transform 2s ease, opacity .5s ease-out
