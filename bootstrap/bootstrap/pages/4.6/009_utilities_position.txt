Position
Use these shorthand utilities for quickly configuring the position of an element.

class

Fixed top
Position an element at the top of the viewport, from edge to edge. Be sure you understand the ramifications of fixed position in your project; you may need to add additional CSS.
class
"fixed-top"
Fixed bottom
Position an element at the bottom of the viewport, from edge to edge. Be sure you understand the ramifications of fixed position in your project; you may need to add additional CSS.
class
"fixed-bottom"
Sticky top
Position an element at the top of the viewport, from edge to edge, but only after you scroll past it. The
.sticky-top
utility uses CSS’s
position: sticky
, which isn’t fully supported in all browsers.
IE11 and IE10 will render
position: sticky
position: relative
As such, we wrap the styles in a
@supports
query, limiting the stickiness to only browsers that can render it properly.
