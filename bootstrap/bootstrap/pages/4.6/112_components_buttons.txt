Buttons
Use Bootstrap’s custom button styles for actions in forms, dialogs, and more with support for multiple sizes, states, and more.

Conveying meaning to assistive technologies
Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies – such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the
.sr-only
class.
Disable text wrapping
If you don’t want the button text to wrap, you can add the
.text-nowrap
class to the button. In Sass, you can set
$btn-white-space: nowrap
to disable text wrapping for each button.
Button tags
.btn
classes are designed to be used with the
<button>
element. However, you can also use these classes on
<input>
elements (though some browsers may apply a slightly different rendering).
When using button classes on
elements that are used to trigger in-page functionality (like collapsing content), rather than linking to new pages or sections within the current page, these links should be given a
role="button"
to appropriately convey their purpose to assistive technologies such as screen readers.

Outline buttons
In need of a button, but not the hefty background colors they bring? Replace the default modifier classes with the
.btn-outline-*
ones to remove all background images and colors on any button.

Some of the button styles use a relatively light foreground color, and should only be used on a dark background in order to have sufficient contrast.

.btn-lg
.btn-sm
for additional sizes.

Active state
Buttons will appear pressed when active with a darker background, darker border, and, when shadows are enabled, an inset shadow.
There’s no need to add a class to
<button>
s as they use a pseudo-class
. However, you can still force the same active appearance with
.active
(and include the
aria-pressed=“true”
attribute) should you need to replicate the state programmatically.

"btn btn-primary btn-lg active"

Disabled state
Make buttons look inactive by adding the
disabled
boolean attribute to any
<button>
element.

Disabled buttons using the
element behave a bit different:
s don’t support the
disabled
attribute, so you must add the
.disabled
class to make it visually appear disabled.
Some future-friendly styles are included to disable all
pointer-events
on anchor buttons. In browsers which support that property, you won’t see the disabled cursor at all.
Disabled buttons using
should include the
aria-disabled="true"
attribute to indicate the state of the element to assistive technologies.
Disabled buttons using
should not
include the
href
attribute.

"btn btn-primary btn-lg disabled"

Link functionality caveat
To cover cases where you have to keep the
href
attribute on a disabled link, the
.disabled
class uses
pointer-events: none
to try to disable the link functionality of
s. Note that this CSS property is not yet standardized for HTML, but all modern browsers support it. In addition, even in browsers that do support
pointer-events: none
, keyboard navigation remains unaffected, meaning that sighted keyboard users and users of assistive technologies will still be able to activate these links. So to be safe, in addition to
aria-disabled="true"
, also include a
tabindex="-1"
attribute on these links to prevent them from receiving keyboard focus, and use custom JavaScript to disable their functionality altogether.

Button plugin
Do more with buttons. Control button states or create groups of buttons for more components like toolbars.
Toggle states
data-toggle="button"
to toggle a button’s
active
state. If you’re pre-toggling a button, you must manually add the
.active
class
aria-pressed="true"
to the
<button>
Single toggle
button
type
"button"
class
"btn btn-primary"
data-toggle
"button"
aria-pressed
"false"
Single toggle
button
Checkbox and radio buttons
.button
styles can be applied to other elements, such as
<label>
s, to provide checkbox or radio style button toggling. Add
data-toggle="buttons"
to a
.btn-group
containing those modified buttons to enable their toggling behavior via JavaScript and add
.btn-group-toggle
to style the
<input>
s within your buttons.
Note that you can create single input-powered buttons or groups of them.
The checked state for these buttons is
only updated via
click
event
on the button. If you use another method to update the input—e.g., with
<input type="reset">
or by manually applying the input’s
checked
property—you’ll need to toggle
.active
on the
<label>
manually.
Note that pre-checked buttons require you to manually add the
.active
class to the input’s
