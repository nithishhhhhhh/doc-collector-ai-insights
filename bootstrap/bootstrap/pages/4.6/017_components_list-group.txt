List group
List groups are a flexible and powerful component for displaying a series of content. Modify and extend them to support just about any content within.
Basic example
The most basic list group is an unordered list with list items and the proper classes. Build upon it with the options that follow, or with your own CSS as needed.
An item
A second item
A third item
A fourth item
And a fifth one
class
"list-group"
class
"list-group-item"
An item
class
"list-group-item"
A second item
class
"list-group-item"
A third item
class
"list-group-item"
A fourth item
class
"list-group-item"
And a fifth one
Active items
.active
to a
.list-group-item
to indicate the current active selection.
An active item
A second item
A third item
A fourth item
And a fifth one
class
"list-group"
class
"list-group-item active"
aria-current
"true"
An active item
class
"list-group-item"
A second item
class
"list-group-item"
A third item
class
"list-group-item"
A fourth item
class
"list-group-item"
And a fifth one
Disabled items
.disabled
to a
.list-group-item
to make it
appear
disabled. Note that some elements with
.disabled
will also require custom JavaScript to fully disable their click events (e.g., links).
A disabled item
A second item
A third item
A fourth item
And a fifth one
class
"list-group"
class
"list-group-item disabled"
aria-disabled
"true"
A disabled item
class
"list-group-item"
A second item
class
"list-group-item"
A third item
class
"list-group-item"
A fourth item
class
"list-group-item"
And a fifth one
Links and buttons
s or
<button>
s to create
actionable
list group items with hover, disabled, and active states by adding
.list-group-item-action
. We separate these pseudo-classes to ensure list groups made of non-interactive elements (like
<li>
s or
<div>
s) don’t provide a click or tap affordance.
Be sure to
not use the standard
.btn
classes here
The current link item
A second link item
A third link item
A fourth link item
A disabled link item
class
"list-group"
href
class
"list-group-item list-group-item-action active"
aria-current
"true"
The current link item

class
"list-group-item list-group-item-action"
A second link item

class
"list-group-item list-group-item-action"
A third link item
href
class
"list-group-item list-group-item-action"
A fourth link item
class
"list-group-item list-group-item-action disabled"
A disabled link item
With
<button>
s, you can also make use of the
disabled
attribute instead of the
.disabled
class. Sadly,
s don’t support the disabled attribute.

Flush
.list-group-flush
to remove some borders and rounded corners to render list group items edge-to-edge in a parent container (e.g., cards).
An item
A second item
A third item
A fourth item
And a fifth one
class
"list-group list-group-flush"
class
"list-group-item"
An item
class
"list-group-item"
A second item
class
"list-group-item"
A third item
class
"list-group-item"
A fourth item
class
"list-group-item"
And a fifth one
Horizontal
.list-group-horizontal
to change the layout of list group items from vertical to horizontal across all breakpoints. Alternatively, choose a responsive variant
.list-group-horizontal-{sm|md|lg|xl}
to make a list group horizontal starting at that breakpoint’s
min-width
. Currently
horizontal list groups cannot be combined with flush list groups.
ProTip:
Want equal-width list group items when horizontal? Add
.flex-fill
to each list group item.

Contextual classes
Use contextual classes to style list items with a stateful background and color.
A simple default list group item
A simple primary list group item
A simple secondary list group item
A simple success list group item
A simple danger list group item
A simple warning list group item
A simple info list group item
A simple light list group item
A simple dark list group item
class
"list-group"
class
"list-group-item"
A simple default list group item
class
"list-group-item list-group-item-primary"
A simple primary list group item
class
"list-group-item list-group-item-secondary"
A simple secondary list group item
class
"list-group-item list-group-item-success"
A simple success list group item
class
"list-group-item list-group-item-danger"
A simple danger list group item
class
"list-group-item list-group-item-warning"
A simple warning list group item
class
"list-group-item list-group-item-info"
A simple info list group item
class
"list-group-item list-group-item-light"
A simple light list group item
class
"list-group-item list-group-item-dark"
A simple dark list group item
Contextual classes also work with
.list-group-item-action
. Note the addition of the hover styles here not present in the previous example. Also supported is the
.active
state; apply it to indicate an active selection on a contextual list group item.

Conveying meaning to assistive technologies
Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies – such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the
.sr-only
class.

Add badges to any list group item to show unread counts, activity, and more with the help of some
utilities

JavaScript behavior
Use the tab JavaScript plugin—include it individually or through the compiled
file—to extend our list group to create tabbable panes of local content.

Some placeholder content in a paragraph relating to "Home". And some more content, used here just to pad out and fill this tab panel. In production, you would obviously have more real content here. And not just text. It could be anything, really. Text, images, forms.

Using data attributes
You can activate a list group navigation without writing any JavaScript by simply specifying
data-toggle="list"
or on an element. Use these data attributes on
.list-group-item
role
"tabpanel"
<!-- List group -->
class
"list-group"
"myList"
role
"tablist"
class
"list-group-item list-group-item-action active"
data-toggle
"list"
href
"#home"
role
"tab"
Home
class
"list-group-item list-group-item-action"
data-toggle

class

data-toggle

role

Via JavaScript
Enable tabbable list item via JavaScript (each list item needs to be activated individually):
'#myList a'
'click'
function
event
event
preventDefault
this
'show'
You can activate individual list item in several ways:
'#myList a[href="#profile"]'
'show'
// Select tab by name
'#myList a:first-child'
'show'
// Select first tab
'#myList a:last-child'
'show'
// Select last tab
'#myList a:nth-child(3)'
'show'
// Select third tab
Fade effect
To make tabs panel fade in, add
.fade
to each
.tab-pane
. The first tab pane must also have
.show
to make the initial content visible.

"tab-content"

"tab-pane fade show active"

script
function
'#myList a:last-child'
'show'
script
.tab(‘show’)
Selects the given list item and shows its associated pane. Any other list item that was previously selected becomes unselected and its associated pane is hidden.
Returns to the caller before the tab pane has actually been shown
(for example, before the
shown.bs.tab
event occurs).
'#someListItem'
'show'
Events
When showing a new tab, the events fire in the following order:
hide.bs.tab
(on the current active tab)
show.bs.tab
(on the to-be-shown tab)
hidden.bs.tab
(on the previous active tab, the same one as for the
hide.bs.tab
event)
shown.bs.tab
(on the newly-active just-shown tab, the same one as for the
show.bs.tab
event)
If no tab was already active, the
hide.bs.tab
hidden.bs.tab
events will not be fired.
Event type
Description
show.bs.tab
This event fires on tab show, but before the new tab has been shown. Use
event.target
event.relatedTarget
to target the active tab and the previous active tab (if available) respectively.
shown.bs.tab
This event fires on tab show after a tab has been shown. Use
event.target
event.relatedTarget
to target the active tab and the previous active tab (if available) respectively.
hide.bs.tab
This event fires when a new tab is to be shown (and thus the previous active tab is to be hidden). Use
event.target
event.relatedTarget
to target the current active tab and the new soon-to-be-active tab, respectively.
hidden.bs.tab
This event fires after a new tab is shown (and thus the previous active tab is hidden). Use
event.target
event.relatedTarget
to target the previous active tab and the new active tab, respectively.
