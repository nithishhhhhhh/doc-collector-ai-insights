Modal
Use Bootstrap’s JavaScript modal plugin to add dialogs to your site for lightboxes, user notifications, or completely custom content.
How it works
Before getting started with Bootstrap’s modal component, be sure to read the following as our menu options have recently changed.
Modals are built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They’re positioned over everything else in the document and remove scroll from the
<body>
so that modal content scrolls instead.
Clicking on the modal “backdrop” will automatically close the modal.
Modals use
position: fixed
, which can sometimes be a bit particular about its rendering. Whenever possible, place your modal HTML in a top-level position to avoid potential interference from other elements. You’ll likely run into issues when nesting a
.modal
within another fixed element.
Once again, due to
position: fixed
, there are some caveats with using modals on mobile devices.
See our browser support docs
for details.
Due to how HTML5 defines its semantics,
autofocus
HTML attribute
has no effect in Bootstrap modals. To achieve the same effect, use some custom JavaScript:
'#myModal'
'shown.bs.modal'
function
'#myInput'
trigger
'focus'
The animation effect of this component is dependent on the
prefers-reduced-motion
media query. See the
reduced motion section of our accessibility documentation
Keep reading for demos and usage guidelines.
Examples
Modal components
Below is a
static
modal example (meaning its
position
display
have been overridden). Included are the modal header, modal body (required for
padding
), and modal footer (optional). We ask that you include modal headers with dismiss actions whenever possible, or provide another explicit dismiss action.

Scrolling long content
When modals become too long for the user’s viewport or device, they scroll independent of the page itself. Try the demo below to see what we mean.
Modal title
What follows is just some placeholder text for this modal dialog. Sipping on Rosé, Silver Lake sun, coming up all lazy. It’s in the palm of your hand now baby. So we hit the boulevard. So make a wish, I'll make it like your birthday everyday. Do you ever feel already buried deep six feet under? It's time to bring out the big balloons. You could've been the greatest. Passport stamps, she's cosmopolitan. Your kiss is cosmic, every move is magic.
We're living the life. We're doing it right. Open up your heart. I was tryna hit it and quit it. Her love is like a drug. Always leaves a trail of stardust. The girl's a freak, she drive a jeep in Laguna Beach. Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock. All my girls vintage Chanel baby.
Before you met me I was alright but things were kinda heavy. Peach-pink lips, yeah, everybody stares. This is no big deal. Calling out my name. I could have rewrite your addiction. She's got that, je ne sais quoi, you know it. Heavy is the head that wears the crown. 'Cause, baby, you're a firework. Like thunder gonna shake the ground.
Just own the night like the 4th of July! I’m gon’ put her in a coma. What you're waiting for, it's time for you to show it off. Can't replace you with a million rings. You open my eyes and I'm ready to go, lead me into the light. And here you are. I’m gon’ put her in a coma. Come on, let your colours burst. So cover your eyes, I have a surprise. As I march alone to a different beat. Glitter all over the room pink flamingos in the pool.
You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine! Come just as you are to me. Just own the night like the 4th of July. Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison. Come just as you are to me. End of the rainbow looking treasure.
I can't sleep let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back. I can't sleep let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back. Yes, we make angels cry, raining down on earth from up above. I'm walking on air (tonight). Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans. Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes. I went from zero, to my own hero. Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon. Make 'em go, 'Aah, aah, aah' as you shoot across the sky-y-y! Why don't you let me stop by?
Boom, boom, boom. Never made me blink one time. Yeah, you're lucky if you're on her plane. Talk about our future like we had a clue. Oh my God no exaggeration. You're original, cannot be replaced. The girl's a freak, she drive a jeep in Laguna Beach. It's no big deal, it's no big deal, it's no big deal. In another life I would make you stay. I'm ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans. I wanna walk on your wave length and be there when you vibrate Never made me blink one time.
We'd keep all our promises be us against the world. If you get the chance you better keep her. It's time to bring out the big, big, big, big, big, big balloons. I hope you got a healthy appetite. Don't let the greatness get you down, oh, oh yeah. Yeah, she's footloose and so fancy free. I want the jaw droppin', eye poppin', head turnin', body shockin'. End of the rainbow looking treasure.

And on my 18th Birthday we got matching tattoos. So open up your heart and just let it begin. 'Cause she's the muse and the artist. She eats your heart out. Like Jeffrey Dahmer (woo). Pop your confetti. (This is how we do) I know one spark will shock the world, yeah yeah. If you only knew what the future holds.

Using the grid
Utilize the Bootstrap grid system within a modal by nesting
.container-fluid
within the
.modal-body
. Then, use the normal grid system classes as you would anywhere else.

.col-md-4 .ml-auto

Varying modal content
Have a bunch of buttons that all trigger the same modal with slightly different contents? Use
event.relatedTarget
HTML
data-*
attributes
(possibly
via jQuery
) to vary the contents of the modal depending on which button was clicked.
Below is a live demo followed by example HTML and JavaScript. For more information,

Change animation
$modal-fade-transform
variable determines the transform state of
.modal-dialog
before the modal fade-in animation, the
$modal-show-transform
variable determines the transform of
.modal-dialog
at the end of the modal fade-in animation.
If you want for example a zoom-in animation, you can set
$modal-fade-transform: scale(.8)
Remove animation
For modals that simply appear rather than fade in to view, remove the
.fade
class from your modal markup.
class
"modal"
tabindex
"-1"
aria-labelledby
"..."
aria-hidden
"true"
Dynamic heights
If the height of a modal changes while it is open, you should call
$('#myModal').modal('handleUpdate')
to readjust the modal’s position in case a scrollbar appears.
Accessibility
Be sure to add
aria-labelledby="..."
, referencing the modal title, to
.modal
. Additionally, you may give a description of your modal dialog with
aria-describedby
.modal
. Note that you don’t need to add
role="dialog"
since we already add it via JavaScript.
Embedding YouTube videos
Embedding YouTube videos in modals requires additional JavaScript not in Bootstrap to automatically stop playback and more.
See this helpful Stack Overflow post
for more information.
Optional sizes
Modals have three optional sizes, available via modifier classes to be placed on a
.modal-dialog
. These sizes kick in at certain breakpoints to avoid horizontal scrollbars on narrower viewports.

Usage
The modal plugin toggles your hidden content on demand, via data attributes or JavaScript. It also adds
.modal-open
to the
<body>
to override default scrolling behavior and generates a
.modal-backdrop
to provide a click area for dismissing shown modals when clicking outside the modal.
Via data attributes
Activate a modal without writing JavaScript. Set
data-toggle="modal"
on a controller element, like a button, along with a
data-target="#foo"
href="#foo"
to target a specific modal to toggle.
button

"button"

Via JavaScript
Call a modal with id
myModal
with a single line of JavaScript:

Methods
Asynchronous methods and transitions
All API methods are
asynchronous
and start a
transition
. They return to the caller as soon as the transition is started but
before it ends
. In addition, a method call on a
transitioning component will be ignored
See our JavaScript documentation for more information
.modal(options)
Activates your content as a modal. Accepts an optional options
object
'#myModal'
modal
keyboard
false
.modal('toggle')
Manually toggles a modal.

shown.bs.modal
hidden.bs.modal
event occurs).
'#myModal'
modal
'toggle'
.modal('show')
Manually opens a modal.
Returns to the caller before the modal has actually been shown
(i.e. before the
