Typography
Documentation and examples for Bootstrap typography, including global settings, headings, body text, lists, and more.
Global settings
textual utility classes
Use a
native font stack
that selects the best
font-family
for each OS and device.
For a more inclusive and accessible type scale, we use the browser’s default root
font-size
(typically 16px) so visitors can customize their browser defaults as needed.
Use the
$font-family-base
$font-size-base
, and
$line-height-base
attributes as our typographic base applied to the
<body>
Set the global link color via
$link-color
and apply link underlines only on
:hover
$body-bg
to set a
background-color
on the
<body>
#fff
by default).
These styles can be found within
_reboot.scss
, and the global variables are defined in
_variables.scss
. Make sure to set
$font-size-base

Display headings
Traditional heading elements are designed to work best in the meat of your page content. When you need a heading to stand out, consider using a
display heading
—a larger, slightly more opinionated heading style. Keep in mind these headings are not responsive by default, but it’s possible to enable
responsive font sizes

Lists
Unstyled
Remove the default
list-style
and left margin on list items (immediate children only).
This only applies to immediate children list items
, meaning you will need to add the class for any nested lists as well.
This is a list.
It appears completely unstyled.
Structurally, it's still a list.
However, this style only applies to immediate child elements.
Nested lists:
are unaffected by this style
will still show a bullet
and have appropriate left margin
This may still come in handy in some situations.
class
"list-unstyled"
This is a list.
It appears completely unstyled.

However, this style only applies to immediate child elements.
Nested lists:

and have appropriate left margin

Inline
Remove a list’s bullets and apply some light
margin
with a combination of two classes,
.list-inline
.list-inline-item
This is a list item.
And another one.
But they're displayed inline.
class
"list-inline"
class
"list-inline-item"
This is a list item.
class
"list-inline-item"
And another one.
class
"list-inline-item"
But they're displayed inline.
Description list alignment
Align terms and descriptions horizontally by using our grid system’s predefined classes (or semantic mixins). For longer terms, you can optionally add a
.text-truncate
class to truncate the text with an ellipsis.
Description lists
A description list is perfect for defining terms.
Term
Definition for the term.
And some more placeholder definition text.
Another term
This definition is short, so no extra paragraphs or anything.
Truncated term is truncated
This can be useful when space is tight. Adds an ellipsis at the end.
Nesting

I heard you like definition lists. Let me put a definition list inside your definition list.

Responsive font sizes
As of v4.3.0, Bootstrap ships with the option to enable responsive font sizes, allowing text to scale more naturally across device and viewport sizes.
can be enabled by changing the
$enable-responsive-font-sizes
Sass variable to
true
and recompiling Bootstrap.
To support
, we use a Sass mixin to replace our normal
font-size
properties. Responsive font sizes will be compiled into
calc()
functions with a mix of
and viewport units to enable the responsive scaling behavior. More about
and its configuration can be found on its
GitHub repository
