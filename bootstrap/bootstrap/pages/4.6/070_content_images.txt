Images
Documentation and examples for opting images into responsive behavior (so they never become larger than their parent elements) and add lightweight styles to them—all via classes.
Responsive images
Images in Bootstrap are made responsive with
.img-fluid
max-width: 100%;
height: auto;
are applied to the image so that it scales with the parent element.

SVG images and Internet Explorer
In Internet Explorer 10 and 11, SVG images with
.img-fluid
are disproportionately sized. To fix this, add
width: 100%;
.w-100
where necessary. This fix improperly sizes other image formats, so Bootstrap doesn’t apply it automatically.
Image thumbnails
In addition to our
border-radius utilities
, you can use
.img-thumbnail
to give an image a rounded 1px border appearance.

Picture
If you are using the
<picture>
element to specify multiple
<source>
elements for a specific
<img>
, make sure to add the
.img-*
classes to the
<img>
and not to the
<picture>
tag.
