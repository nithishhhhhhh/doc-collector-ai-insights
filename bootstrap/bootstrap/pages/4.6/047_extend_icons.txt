Icons
Guidance and suggestions for using external icon libraries with Bootstrap.
While you won’t find a built-in icon library in Bootstrap, our separate
projects is a growing set of open source SVGs you can use. While they’re designed first and foremost to work with our components and documentation, you can use them in any project.

Additional icon sets
In addition to Bootstrap Icons, we have a handful of alternative icon libraries for you to choose from. While most icon sets include multiple file formats, we prefer SVG implementations for their improved accessibility and vector support.
