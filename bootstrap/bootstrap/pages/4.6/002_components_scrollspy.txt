Scrollspy
Automatically update Bootstrap navigation or list group components based on scroll position to indicate which link is currently active in the viewport.
How it works
Scrollspy has a few requirements to function properly:
If you’re building our JavaScript from source, it
requires
util.js
It must be used on a Bootstrap
nav component
list group
Scrollspy requires
position: relative;
on the element you’re spying on, usually the
<body>
When spying on elements other than the
<body>
, be sure to have a
height
set and
overflow-y: scroll;
applied.
Anchors (
) are required and must point to an element with that
When successfully implemented, your nav or list group will update accordingly, moving the
.active
class from one item to the next based on their associated targets.
Example in navbar
Scroll the area below the navbar and watch the active class change. The dropdown items will be highlighted as well.

Placeholder content for the scrollspy example. You got the finest architecture. Passport stamps, she's cosmopolitan. Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock. Never planned that one day I'd be losing you. She eats your heart out. Your kiss is cosmic, every move is magic. I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one. Greetings loved ones let's take a journey. Just own the night like the 4th of July! But you'd rather get wasted.
@mdo
Placeholder content for the scrollspy example. 'Cause she's the muse and the artist. (This is how we do) So you wanna play with magic. So just be sure before you give it all to me. I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight). Skip the talk, heard it all, time to walk the walk.
Placeholder content for the scrollspy example. Takes you miles high, so high, 'cause she’s got that one international smile. There's a stranger in my bed, there's a pounding in my head. Oh, no. In another life I would make you stay. ‘Cause I, I’m capable of anything. Suiting up for my crowning battle. Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof. Tone, tan fit and ready, turn it up cause its gettin' heavy. Her love is like a drug. I guess that I forgot I had a choice.
Placeholder content for the scrollspy example. It's time to bring out the big balloons. I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight). Yeah, we maxed our credit cards and got kicked out of the bar. Yo, shout out to all you kids, buying bottle service, with your rent money. I'm ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans. If you get the chance you better keep her. Yo, shout out to all you kids, buying bottle service, with your rent money.

So let me get you in your birthday suit. The one that got away. Last Friday night, yeah I think we broke the law, always say we're gonna stop. 'Cause she's a little bit of Yoko, And she's a little bit of 'Oh no'. I want the jaw droppin', eye poppin', head turnin', body shockin'. Yeah, we maxed our credit cards and got kicked out of the bar.
And some more placeholder content, for good measure.

Usage
Via data attributes
To easily add scrollspy behavior to your topbar navigation, add
data-spy="scroll"
to the element you want to spy on (most typically this would be the
<body>
). Then add the
data-target
attribute with the ID or class of the parent element of any Bootstrap
.nav
component.
body
position
relative
body
data-spy
"scroll"
data-target
"#navbar-example"
"navbar-example"
class
"nav nav-tabs"
role
"tablist"
body
Via JavaScript
After adding
position: relative;
in your CSS, call the scrollspy via JavaScript:
'body'
scrollspy
target
'#navbar-example'
Resolvable ID targets required
Navbar links must have resolvable id targets. For example, a
<a href="#home">home</a>
must correspond to something in the DOM like
<div id="home"></div>
Non-
:visible
target elements ignored
Target elements that are not
:visible
according to jQuery
will be ignored and their corresponding nav items will never be highlighted.
Methods
.scrollspy('refresh')
When using scrollspy in conjunction with adding or removing of elements from the DOM, you’ll need to call the refresh method like so:
'[data-spy="scroll"]'
each
function
$spy
this
scrollspy
'refresh'
.scrollspy('dispose')
Destroys an element’s scrollspy.
