Updated Components and Utilities

Accessibility has been a focus of Bootstrap, with each version making strides in ensuring web content is accessible to all users. Bootstrap 5 emphasizes improvements in form controls, color contrast ratios, and keyboard navigation to meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards more closely.
Enhanced Performance and Best Practices
By removing jQuery and making other optimizations, Bootstrap 5 aims to improve loading times and performance for websites and applications. Version 5 also embraces best practices for responsive design, encouraging a more mobile-first approach to layouts and interactions.
Native Dark Mode Support
While not initially released with Bootstrap 5, subsequent updates have focused on native dark mode and custom color mode support, reflecting a growing trend in user interface design preferences.
…and more!
When and if you can, consider migrating!
Still on Bootstrap 3 or 4?
We know that some folks aren’t able to upgrade or fully migrate for one reason or another, so here are some other options to consider.
Update to the Bootstrap 3 or 4 Final Release (v3.4.1 / v4.6.2)
The latest release of Bootstrap 3 (v3.4.1) and Bootstrap 4 (v4.6.2) were the final releases of these major versions and included security patches for XSS vulnerabilities (v3.x), bug fixes for enhanced stability, and updated documentation for better developer guidance.
These versions will be the starting point for extended support mentioned below.
Purchase Extended Support for Bootstrap 3 and 4
If you have to stay on Bootstrap 3 and 4 post-EOL, we have partnered with HeroDevs to offer Never-Ending Support (NES). NES for Bootstrap 3 and 4 provides ongoing updates and security patches for both versions even after EOL so that applications with strict compliance requirements remain secure and compliant. It also guarantees that Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 applications will continue to operate effectively in modern browsers and maintain compatibility with essential libraries. Finally, Bootstrap NES has continuous security monitoring and a 14-day SLA for fixes.

Notify Your Users of your Bootstrap 3/4 Post-EOL Plan
If you can’t migrate to Bootstrap 5 or use Bootstrap NES at the moment but still remain on Bootstrap 3 or 4, you may need to consider how you will communicate your security plans to your customers.
This does not apply to all Bootstrap users, but many teams are prohibited from shipping unsupported software by SLAs, contracts and agreements, or other obligations to downstream parties. These could be with customers, compliance agencies, or even internal company departments. For an increasing number of industries, governing regulatory bodies are also raising expectations on what software creators are accountable for.
If you work with such business requirements, You may need to let your customers, managers, CIO/CISO, or other relevant stakeholders know about your plan to manage, support and address any potential CVEs. While
that have not received patches in later versions, CVEs do turn up for even the most mature EOL projects—whether directly or via compromised dependencies. Subscribing to CVE notifications through organizations like
OpenCVE
Snyk
can be a good way to find out about vulnerabilities as soon as they’re discovered. Browsers may also ship changes that break legacy libraries—this is rare, but it does happen.
