Text alignment
Easily realign text to components with text alignment classes. For start, end, and center alignment, responsive classes are available that use the same viewport width breakpoints as the grid system.
Start aligned text on all viewport sizes.
Center aligned text on all viewport sizes.
End aligned text on all viewport sizes.
Start aligned text on viewports sized SM (small) or wider.
Start aligned text on viewports sized MD (medium) or wider.
Start aligned text on viewports sized LG (large) or wider.
Start aligned text on viewports sized XL (extra-large) or wider.
class
"text-start"
Start aligned text on all viewport sizes.
class
"text-center"
Center aligned text on all viewport sizes.
class
"text-end"
End aligned text on all viewport sizes.
class
"text-sm-start"
Start aligned text on viewports sized SM (small) or wider.
class
"text-md-start"
Start aligned text on viewports sized MD (medium) or wider.
class
"text-lg-start"
Start aligned text on viewports sized LG (large) or wider.
class
"text-xl-start"
Start aligned text on viewports sized XL (extra-large) or wider.
Note that we don’t provide utility classes for justified text. While, aesthetically, justified text might look more appealing, it does make word-spacing more random and therefore harder to read.
Text wrapping and overflow
Wrap text with a
.text-wrap
class.
This text should wrap.
class
"badge bg-primary text-wrap"
style
"width: 6rem;"
This text should wrap.
Prevent text from wrapping with a
.text-nowrap
class.
This text should overflow the parent.
class
"text-nowrap bd-highlight"
style
"width: 8rem;"
This text should overflow the parent.
Word break
Prevent long strings of text from breaking your components' layout by using
.text-break
to set
word-wrap: break-word
word-break: break-word
. We use
word-wrap
instead of the more common
overflow-wrap
for wider browser support, and add the deprecated
word-break: break-word
to avoid issues with flex containers.
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
class
"text-break"
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Note that
breaking words isn’t possible in Arabic
, which is the most used RTL language. Therefore
.text-break
is removed from our RTL compiled CSS.
Text transform
Transform text in components with text capitalization classes.
Lowercased text.
Uppercased text.
CapiTaliZed text.
class
"text-lowercase"
Lowercased text.
class
"text-uppercase"
Uppercased text.
class
"text-capitalize"
CapiTaliZed text.
Note how
.text-capitalize
only changes the first letter of each word, leaving the case of any other letters unaffected.
Font size
Quickly change the
font-size
of text. While our heading classes (e.g.,
) apply
font-size
font-weight
, and
line-height
, these utilities
only
apply
font-size
. Sizing for these utilities matches HTML’s heading elements, so as the number increases, their size decreases.
.fs-1 text
.fs-2 text
.fs-3 text
.fs-4 text
.fs-5 text
.fs-6 text
class
"fs-1"
.fs-1 text
class

"fs-3"
.fs-3 text
class
"fs-4"
.fs-4 text
class

Customize your available
font-size
s by modifying the

Sass map.

This is a long paragraph written to show how the line-height of an element is affected by our utilities. Classes are applied to the element itself or sometimes the parent element. These classes can be customized as needed with our utility API.
