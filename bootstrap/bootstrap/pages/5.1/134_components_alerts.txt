==================================================

Examples
Alerts are available for any length of text, as well as an optional close button. For proper styling, use one of the eight
required
contextual classes (e.g.,
.alert-success
). For inline dismissal, use the
alerts JavaScript plugin
A simple primary alert—check it out!
A simple secondary alert—check it out!
A simple success alert—check it out!
A simple danger alert—check it out!
A simple warning alert—check it out!
A simple info alert—check it out!
A simple light alert—check it out!
A simple dark alert—check it out!

Conveying meaning to assistive technologies
Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies – such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the
.visually-hidden
class.
Live example
Click the button below to show an alert (hidden with inline styles to start), then dismiss (and destroy) it with the built-in close button.

Additional content
Alerts can also contain additional HTML elements like headings, paragraphs and dividers.
Well done!
Aww yeah, you successfully read this important alert message. This example text is going to run a bit longer so that you can see how spacing within an alert works with this kind of content.
Whenever you need to, be sure to use margin utilities to keep things nice and tidy.

Icons
Similarly, you can use
flexbox utilities
to create alerts with icons. Depending on your icons and content, you may want to add more utilities or custom styles.

An example alert with an icon
Need more than one icon for your alerts? Consider using more Bootstrap Icons and making a local SVG sprite like so to easily reference the same icons repeatedly.

Dismissing
Using the alert JavaScript plugin, it’s possible to dismiss any alert inline. Here’s how:
Be sure you’ve loaded the alert plugin, or the compiled Bootstrap JavaScript.
Add a
close button
and the
.alert-dismissible
class, which adds extra padding to the right of the alert and positions the close button.
On the close button, add the
data-bs-dismiss="alert"
attribute, which triggers the JavaScript functionality. Be sure to use the
<button>
element with it for proper behavior across all devices.
To animate alerts when dismissing them, be sure to add the
.fade
.show
classes.
You can see this in action with a live demo:
Holy guacamole!
You should check in on some of those fields below.
class
"alert alert-warning alert-dismissible fade show"
role
"alert"
strong
Holy guacamole!
strong
You should check in on some of those fields below.
button
type
"button"
class
"btn-close"
data-bs-dismiss
"alert"
aria-label
"Close"
button
When an alert is dismissed, the element is completely removed from the page structure. If a keyboard user dismisses the alert using the close button, their focus will suddenly be lost and, depending on the browser, reset to the start of the page/document. For this reason, we recommend including additional JavaScript that listens for the
closed.bs.alert
event and programmatically sets
focus()
to the most appropriate location in the page. If you’re planning to move focus to a non-interactive element that normally does not receive focus, make sure to add
tabindex="-1"
to the element.

Alert
element
For the sole purpose of dismissing an alert, it isn’t necessary to initialize the component manually via the JS API. By making use of
data-bs-dismiss="alert"
, the component will be initialized automatically and properly dismissed.
See the
triggers
section for more details.
Triggers
Dismissal can be achieved with the
data
attribute on a button
within the alert
as demonstrated below:
button
type
"button"
class
"btn-close"
data-bs-dismiss
"alert"
aria-label
"Close"
button
or on a button
outside the alert
using the
data-bs-target
as demonstrated below:
button
type
"button"
class
"btn-close"
data-bs-dismiss
"alert"
data-bs-target
"#my-alert"
aria-label
"Close"
button
Note that closing an alert will remove it from the DOM.
Methods
Method
Description
close
Closes an alert by removing it from the DOM. If the
.fade
.show
classes are present on the element, the alert will fade out before it is removed.
dispose
Destroys an element's alert. (Removes stored data on the DOM element)
getInstance
Static method which allows you to get the alert instance associated to a DOM element, you can use it like this:
getOrCreateInstance
Static method which returns an alert instance associated to a DOM element or create a new one in case it wasn't initialized.
You can use it like this:
alertNode
document
querySelector
'.alert'
alert
Alert
getInstance
alertNode
alert
close
Events
Event
Description
close.bs.alert
Fires immediately when the
close
instance method is called.
closed.bs.alert
Fired when the alert has been closed and CSS transitions have completed.

getElementById
'myAlert'
myAlert
addEventListener
'closed.bs.alert'
function
// do something, for instance, explicitly move focus to the most appropriate element,
// so it doesn't get lost/reset to the start of the page
// document.getElementById('...').focus()
