==================================================

How they work
Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are
required when using our default grid system
. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers
be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.
.container
, which sets a
max-width
at each responsive breakpoint
.container-fluid
, which is
width: 100%
at all breakpoints
.container-{breakpoint}
, which is
width: 100%
until the specified breakpoint
The table below illustrates how each container’s
max-width
compares to the original
.container
.container-fluid
across each breakpoint.

Default container
Our default
.container
class is a responsive, fixed-width container, meaning its
max-width
changes at each breakpoint.
class
"container"
<!-- Content here -->
Responsive containers
Responsive containers allow you to specify a class that is 100% wide until the specified breakpoint is reached, after which we apply
max-width
s for each of the higher breakpoints. For example,
.container-sm
is 100% wide to start until the
breakpoint is reached, where it will scale up with
, and
class
"container-sm"
100% wide until small breakpoint
class
"container-md"
100% wide until medium breakpoint
class
"container-lg"
100% wide until large breakpoint
class
"container-xl"
100% wide until extra large breakpoint
class
"container-xxl"
100% wide until extra extra large breakpoint
Fluid containers
.container-fluid
for a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.
class
"container-fluid"
Sass
As shown above, Bootstrap generates a series of predefined container classes to help you build the layouts you desire. You may customize these predefined container classes by modifying the Sass map (found in
_variables.scss
) that powers them:
$container-max-widths
1140
1320
In addition to customizing the Sass, you can also create your own containers with our Sass mixin.
// Source mixin
@mixin
make-container
$padding-x
$container-padding-x
width
padding-right
$padding-x
padding-left
$padding-x
margin-right
auto
margin-left
auto
// Usage
.custom-container
@include
make-container
