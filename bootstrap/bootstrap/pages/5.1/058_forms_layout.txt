==================================================

Forms
Every group of form fields should reside in a
<form>
element. Bootstrap provides no default styling for the
<form>
element, but there are some powerful browser features that are provided by default.
New to browser forms? Consider reviewing
the MDN form docs
for an overview and complete list of available attributes.
<button>
s within a
<form>
default to
type="submit"
, so strive to be specific and always include a
type
You can disable every form element within a form with the
disabled
attribute on the
<form>
Since Bootstrap applies
display: block
width: 100%
to almost all our form controls, forms will by default stack vertically. Additional classes can be used to vary this layout on a per-form basis.
Utilities
Margin utilities
are the easiest way to add some structure to forms. They provide basic grouping of labels, controls, optional form text, and form validation messaging. We recommend sticking to
margin-bottom
utilities, and using a single direction throughout the form for consistency.
Feel free to build your forms however you like, with
<fieldset>
<div>
s, or nearly any other element.

class
"mb-3"

"formGroupExampleInput"
class
"form-label"

"text"

class
"form-label"
Another label
label
input
type
"text"
class
"form-control"
"formGroupExampleInput2"
placeholder
"Another input placeholder"
Form grid
More complex forms can be built using our grid classes. Use these for form layouts that require multiple columns, varied widths, and additional alignment options.
Requires the
$enable-grid-classes
Sass variable to be enabled
(on by default).
class
"row"
class
"col"
input
type
"text"
class
"form-control"
placeholder
"First name"
aria-label
"First name"
class
"col"
input
type
"text"
class
"form-control"
placeholder
"Last name"
aria-label
"Last name"
Gutters
By adding
gutter modifier classes
, you can have control over the gutter width in as well the inline as block direction.
Also requires the
$enable-grid-classes
Sass variable to be enabled
(on by default).
class
"row g-3"
class
"col"
input
type
"text"
class
"form-control"
placeholder
"First name"
aria-label
"First name"
class
"col"
input
type
"text"
class
"form-control"
placeholder
"Last name"
aria-label
"Last name"
More complex layouts can also be created with the grid system.

Horizontal form
Create horizontal forms with the grid by adding the
.row
class to form groups and using the
.col-*-*
classes to specify the width of your labels and controls. Be sure to add
.col-form-label
to your
<label>
s as well so they’re vertically centered with their associated form controls.
At times, you maybe need to use margin or padding utilities to create that perfect alignment you need. For example, we’ve removed the
padding-top
on our stacked radio inputs label to better align the text baseline.

Column sizing
As shown in the previous examples, our grid system allows you to place any number of
.col
s within a
.row
. They’ll split the available width equally between them. You may also pick a subset of your columns to take up more or less space, while the remaining
.col
s equally split the rest, with specific column classes like
.col-sm-7
class
"row g-3"
class
"col-sm-7"
input
type
"text"
class
"form-control"
placeholder
"City"
aria-label
"City"

class

type

class
"form-control"
placeholder
"Zip"
aria-label
"Zip"
Auto-sizing
The example below uses a flexbox utility to vertically center the contents and changes
.col
.col-auto
so that your columns only take up as much space as needed. Put another way, the column sizes itself based on the contents.

Inline forms
Use the
.row-cols-*
classes to create responsive horizontal layouts. By adding
gutter modifier classes
, we’ll have gutters in horizontal and vertical directions. On narrow mobile viewports, the
.col-12
helps stack the form controls and more. The
.align-items-center
aligns the form elements to the middle, making the
.form-checkbox
align properly.
