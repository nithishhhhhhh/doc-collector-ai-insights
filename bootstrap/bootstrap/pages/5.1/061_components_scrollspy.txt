==================================================

How it works
Scrollspy has a few requirements to function properly:
It must be used on a Bootstrap
nav component
list group
Scrollspy requires
position: relative;
on the element you’re spying on, usually the
<body>
Anchors (
) are required and must point to an element with that
When successfully implemented, your nav or list group will update accordingly, moving the
.active
class from one item to the next based on their associated targets.
Scrollable containers and keyboard access
If you’re making a scrollable container (other than the
<body>
), be sure to have a
height
set and
overflow-y: scroll;
applied to it—alongside a
tabindex="0"
to ensure keyboard access.
Example in navbar
Scroll the area below the navbar and watch the active class change. The dropdown items will be highlighted as well.
First heading
This is some placeholder content for the scrollspy page. Note that as you scroll down the page, the appropriate navigation link is highlighted. It's repeated throughout the component example. We keep adding some more example copy here to emphasize the scrolling and highlighting.

Example with nested nav
Scrollspy also works with nested
.nav
s. If a nested
.nav
.active
, its parents will also be
.active
. Scroll the area next to the navbar and watch the active class change.

Usage
Via data attributes
To easily add scrollspy behavior to your topbar navigation, add
data-bs-spy="scroll"
to the element you want to spy on (most typically this would be the
<body>
). Then add the
data-bs-target
attribute with the ID or class of the parent element of any Bootstrap
.nav
component.
body
position
relative
body
data-bs-spy
"scroll"
data-bs-target
"#navbar-example"
"navbar-example"
class
"nav nav-tabs"
role
"tablist"
body
Via JavaScript
After adding
position: relative;
in your CSS, call the scrollspy via JavaScript:
scrollSpy
ScrollSpy
document
body
target
'#navbar-example'
Resolvable ID targets required
Navbar links must have resolvable id targets. For example, a
<a href="#home">home</a>
must correspond to something in the DOM like
<div id="home"></div>
Non-visible target elements ignored
Target elements that are not visible will be ignored and their corresponding nav items will never be highlighted.
Methods
refresh
When using scrollspy in conjunction with adding or removing of elements from the DOM, you’ll need to call the refresh method like so:
dataSpyList
slice
call
document
querySelectorAll
'[data-bs-spy="scroll"]'
dataSpyList
forEach
function
dataSpyEl
ScrollSpy
getInstance
dataSpyEl
refresh
dispose
Destroys an element’s scrollspy. (Removes stored data on the DOM element)
getInstance
Static
method which allows you to get the scrollspy instance associated with a DOM element
scrollSpyContentEl
document
getElementById
'content'
scrollSpy
ScrollSpy
getInstance
scrollSpyContentEl
// Returns a Bootstrap scrollspy instance
getOrCreateInstance
Static
method which allows you to get the scrollspy instance associated with a DOM element, or create a new one in case it wasn’t initialized
scrollSpyContentEl
document
getElementById
'content'
scrollSpy
ScrollSpy
getOrCreateInstance
scrollSpyContentEl
// Returns a Bootstrap scrollspy instance
Options
Options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to
data-bs-
, as in
data-bs-offset=""
