Example
Use an ordered or unordered list with linked list items to create a minimally styled breadcrumb. Use our utilities to add additional styles as desired.
aria-label
"breadcrumb"
class
"breadcrumb"
class
"breadcrumb-item active"
aria-current
"page"
Home
aria-label
"breadcrumb"
class
"breadcrumb"
class
"breadcrumb-item"
href
Home
class
"breadcrumb-item active"
aria-current
"page"
Library
aria-label
"breadcrumb"
class
"breadcrumb"
class
"breadcrumb-item"
href
Home
class
"breadcrumb-item"
href
Library
class
"breadcrumb-item active"
aria-current
"page"
Data
Dividers
Dividers are automatically added in CSS through
::before
content
. They can be changed by modifying a local CSS custom property
--bs-breadcrumb-divider
, or through the
$breadcrumb-divider
Sass variable — and
$breadcrumb-divider-flipped
for its RTL counterpart, if needed. We default to our Sass variable, which is set as a fallback to the custom property. This way, you get a global divider that you can override without recompiling CSS at any time.
style
"--bs-breadcrumb-divider: '>';"
aria-label
"breadcrumb"
class
"breadcrumb"
class
"breadcrumb-item"
href
Home
class
"breadcrumb-item active"
aria-current
"page"
Library
When modifying via Sass, the
quote
function is required to generate the quotes around a string. For example, using
as the divider, you can use this:
$breadcrumb-divider
quote
It’s also possible to use an
embedded SVG icon
. Apply it via our CSS custom property, or use the Sass variable.
style
"--bs-breadcrumb-divider: url(&#34;data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='8' height='8'%3E%3Cpath d='M2.5 0L1 1.5 3.5 4 1 6.5 2.5 8l4-4-4-4z' fill='currentColor'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&#34;);"
aria-label
"breadcrumb"
class
"breadcrumb"
class
"breadcrumb-item"
href
Home
class
"breadcrumb-item active"
aria-current
"page"
Library
$breadcrumb-divider
url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='8' height='8'%3E%3Cpath d='M2.5 0L1 1.5 3.5 4 1 6.5 2.5 8l4-4-4-4z' fill='currentColor'/%3E%3C/svg%3E")
You can also remove the divider setting
--bs-breadcrumb-divider: '';
(empty strings in CSS custom properties counts as a value), or setting the Sass variable to
$breadcrumb-divider: none;
style
"--bs-breadcrumb-divider: '';"
aria-label
"breadcrumb"
class
"breadcrumb"
class
"breadcrumb-item"
href
Home
class
"breadcrumb-item active"
aria-current
"page"
Library
$breadcrumb-divider
none
Accessibility
Since breadcrumbs provide a navigation, it’s a good idea to add a meaningful label such as
aria-label="breadcrumb"
to describe the type of navigation provided in the
<nav>
element, as well as applying an
aria-current="page"
to the last item of the set to indicate that it represents the current page.
