==================================================

About
Use the ratio helper to manage the aspect ratios of external content like
<iframe>
<embed>
<video>
s, and
<object>
s. These helpers also can be used on any standard HTML child element (e.g., a
<div>
<img>
). Styles are applied from the parent
.ratio
class directly to the child.
Aspect ratios are declared in a Sass map and included in each class via CSS variable, which also allows
custom aspect ratios
Pro-Tip!
You don’t need
frameborder="0"
on your
<iframe>
s as we override that for you in
Reboot
Example
Wrap any embed, like an
<iframe>
, in a parent element with
.ratio
and an aspect ratio class. The immediate child element is automatically sized thanks to our universal selector
.ratio > *
class
"ratio ratio-16x9"
iframe
"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zpOULjyy-n8?rel=0"
title
"YouTube video"

Aspect ratios
Aspect ratios can be customized with modifier classes. By default the following ratio classes are provided:
16x9
21x9
class
"ratio ratio-1x1"
class
"ratio ratio-4x3"
class
"ratio ratio-16x9"
16x9
class
"ratio ratio-21x9"
21x9
Custom ratios
Each
.ratio-*
class includes a CSS custom property (or CSS variable) in the selector. You can override this CSS variable to create custom aspect ratios on the fly with some quick math on your part.
For example, to create a 2x1 aspect ratio, set
--bs-aspect-ratio: 50%
on the
.ratio
class
"ratio"
style
"--bs-aspect-ratio: 50%;"
This CSS variable makes it easy to modify the aspect ratio across breakpoints. The following is 4x3 to start, but changes to a custom 2x1 at the medium breakpoint.
.ratio-4x3
@include
media-breakpoint-up
--bs-aspect-ratio
// 2x1
4x3, then 2x1
class
"ratio ratio-4x3"
4x3, then 2x1
Sass map
Within
_variables.scss
, you can change the aspect ratios you want to use. Here’s our default
$ratio-aspect-ratios
map. Modify the map as you like and recompile your Sass to put them to use.
$aspect-ratios
"1x1"
"4x3"
calc
"16x9"
calc
"21x9"
