==================================================

How it works
The collapse JavaScript plugin is used to show and hide content. Buttons or anchors are used as triggers that are mapped to specific elements you toggle. Collapsing an element will animate the
height
from its current value to
. Given how CSS handles animations, you cannot use
padding
on a
.collapse
element. Instead, use the class as an independent wrapping element.
The animation effect of this component is dependent on the
prefers-reduced-motion
media query. See the
reduced motion section of our accessibility documentation
Example
Click the buttons below to show and hide another element via class changes:
.collapse
hides content
.collapsing
is applied during transitions
.collapse.show
shows content
Generally, we recommend using a button with the
data-bs-target
attribute. While not recommended from a semantic point of view, you can also use a link with the
href
attribute (and a
role="button"
). In both cases, the
data-bs-toggle="collapse"
is required.

Horizontal
The collapse plugin also supports horizontal collapsing. Add the
.collapse-horizontal
modifier class to transition the
width
instead of
height
and set a
width
on the immediate child element. Feel free to write your own custom Sass, use inline styles, or use our
width utilities
Please note that while the example below has a
min-height
set to avoid excessive repaints in our docs, this is not explicitly required.
Only the
width
on the child element is required.

Multiple targets
<button>
can show and hide multiple elements by referencing them with a selector in its
href
data-bs-target
attribute.
Multiple
<button>
can show and hide an element if they each reference it with their
href
data-bs-target
attribute

Accessibility
Be sure to add
aria-expanded
to the control element. This attribute explicitly conveys the current state of the collapsible element tied to the control to screen readers and similar assistive technologies. If the collapsible element is closed by default, the attribute on the control element should have a value of
aria-expanded="false"
. If you’ve set the collapsible element to be open by default using the
show
class, set
aria-expanded="true"
on the control instead. The plugin will automatically toggle this attribute on the control based on whether or not the collapsible element has been opened or closed (via JavaScript, or because the user triggered another control element also tied to the same collapsible element). If the control element’s HTML element is not a button (e.g., an
<div>
), the attribute
role="button"
should be added to the element.
If your control element is targeting a single collapsible element – i.e. the
data-bs-target
attribute is pointing to an
selector – you should add the
aria-controls
attribute to the control element, containing the
of the collapsible element. Modern screen readers and similar assistive technologies make use of this attribute to provide users with additional shortcuts to navigate directly to the collapsible element itself.
Note that Bootstrap’s current implementation does not cover the various
optional
keyboard interactions described in the
WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1 accordion pattern
- you will need to include these yourself with custom JavaScript.
Sass
Variables
$transition-collapse
height
ease
$transition-collapse-width
width
ease
Classes
Collapse transition classes can be found in
scss/_transitions.scss
as these are shared across multiple components (collapse and accordion).
.collapse
:not
.show
display
none
.collapsing
height
overflow
hidden
@include
transition
$transition-collapse
.collapse-horizontal
width
height
auto
@include
transition
$transition-collapse-width
Usage
The collapse plugin utilizes a few classes to handle the heavy lifting:
.collapse
hides the content
.collapse.show
shows the content
.collapsing
is added when the transition starts, and removed when it finishes
These classes can be found in
_transitions.scss
Via data attributes
Just add
data-bs-toggle="collapse"
and a
data-bs-target
to the element to automatically assign control of one or more collapsible elements. The
data-bs-target
attribute accepts a CSS selector to apply the collapse to. Be sure to add the class
collapse
to the collapsible element. If you’d like it to default open, add the additional class
show
To add accordion-like group management to a collapsible area, add the data attribute
data-bs-parent="#selector"
. Refer to the
accordion page
for more information.
Via JavaScript
Enable manually with:
collapseElementList
slice
call
document
querySelectorAll
'.collapse'
collapseList
collapseElementList
function
collapseEl
return
Collapse
collapseEl
Options
Options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to
data-bs-
, as in
data-bs-parent=""
Name
Type
Default
Description
parent
selector | jQuery object | DOM element
false
If parent is provided, then all collapsible elements under the specified parent will be closed when this collapsible item is shown. (similar to traditional accordion behavior - this is dependent on the
card
class). The attribute has to be set on the target collapsible area.
toggle
boolean
true
Toggles the collapsible element on invocation
Methods
Asynchronous methods and transitions
All API methods are
asynchronous
and start a
transition
. They return to the caller as soon as the transition is started but
before it ends
. In addition, a method call on a
transitioning component will be ignored
See our JavaScript documentation for more information
Activates your content as a collapsible element. Accepts an optional options
object
You can create a collapse instance with the constructor, for example:
myCollapse
document
getElementById
'myCollapse'
bsCollapse
Collapse
myCollapse
toggle
false
Method
Description
toggle
Toggles a collapsible element to shown or hidden.
Returns to the caller before the collapsible element has actually been shown or hidden
(i.e. before the
shown.bs.collapse
hidden.bs.collapse
event occurs).
show
Shows a collapsible element.
Returns to the caller before the collapsible element has actually been shown
(e.g., before the
shown.bs.collapse
event occurs).
hide
Hides a collapsible element.
Returns to the caller before the collapsible element has actually been hidden
(e.g., before the
hidden.bs.collapse
event occurs).
dispose
Destroys an element's collapse. (Removes stored data on the DOM element)
getInstance
Static method which allows you to get the collapse instance associated to a DOM element, you can use it like this:
getOrCreateInstance
Static method which returns a collapse instance associated to a DOM element or create a new one in case it wasn't initialized.
You can use it like this:
Events
Event type
Description
show.bs.collapse
This event fires immediately when the
show
instance method is called.
shown.bs.collapse
This event is fired when a collapse element has been made visible to the user (will wait for CSS transitions to complete).
hide.bs.collapse
This event is fired immediately when the
hide
method has been called.
hidden.bs.collapse
This event is fired when a collapse element has been hidden from the user (will wait for CSS transitions to complete).
myCollapsible
document
getElementById
'myCollapsible'
myCollapsible
addEventListener
'hidden.bs.collapse'
function
// do something...
