==================================================

Examples
Badges scale to match the size of the immediate parent element by using relative font sizing and
units. As of v5, badges no longer have focus or hover styles for links.

Buttons
Badges can be used as part of links or buttons to provide a counter.

"btn btn-primary"

Note that depending on how they are used, badges may be confusing for users of screen readers and similar assistive technologies. While the styling of badges provides a visual cue as to their purpose, these users will simply be presented with the content of the badge. Depending on the specific situation, these badges may seem like random additional words or numbers at the end of a sentence, link, or button.
Unless the context is clear (as with the “Notifications” example, where it is understood that the “4” is the number of notifications), consider including additional context with a visually hidden piece of additional text.
Positioned
Use utilities to modify a
.badge
and position it in the corner of a link or button.
Inbox

button
type
"button"
class
"btn btn-primary position-relative"
Inbox
span
class
"position-absolute top-0 start-100 translate-middle badge rounded-pill bg-danger"
span
class
"visually-hidden"
unread messages

You can also replace the
.badge
class with a few more utilities without a count for a more generic indicator.

"btn btn-primary position-relative"

Background colors
Use our background utility classes to quickly change the appearance of a badge. Please note that when using Bootstrap’s default
.bg-light
, you’ll likely need a text color utility like
.text-dark
for proper styling. This is because background utilities do not set anything but

Conveying meaning to assistive technologies
Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies – such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the
.visually-hidden
class.
Pill badges
Use the
.rounded-pill
utility class to make badges more rounded with a larger
border-radius
