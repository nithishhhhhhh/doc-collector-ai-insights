==================================================

How it works
Before getting started with Bootstrap’s modal component, be sure to read the following as our menu options have recently changed.
Modals are built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They’re positioned over everything else in the document and remove scroll from the
<body>
so that modal content scrolls instead.
Clicking on the modal “backdrop” will automatically close the modal.
Modals use
position: fixed
, which can sometimes be a bit particular about its rendering. Whenever possible, place your modal HTML in a top-level position to avoid potential interference from other elements. You’ll likely run into issues when nesting a
.modal
within another fixed element.
Once again, due to
position: fixed
, there are some caveats with using modals on mobile devices.
See our browser support docs
for details.
Due to how HTML5 defines its semantics,
autofocus
HTML attribute
has no effect in Bootstrap modals. To achieve the same effect, use some custom JavaScript:
const
myModal
document
getElementById
'myModal'
const
myInput
document
getElementById
'myInput'
myModal
addEventListener
'shown.bs.modal'
myInput
focus
The animation effect of this component is dependent on the
prefers-reduced-motion
media query. See the
reduced motion section of our accessibility documentation
Keep reading for demos and usage guidelines.
Examples
Modal components
Below is a
static
modal example (meaning its
position
display
have been overridden). Included are the modal header, modal body (required for
padding
), and modal footer (optional). We ask that you include modal headers with dismiss actions whenever possible, or provide another explicit dismiss action.

In the above static example, we use
<h5>
, to avoid issues with the heading hierarchy in the documentation page. Structurally, however, a modal dialog represents its own separate document/context, so the
.modal-title
should ideally be an
<h1>
. If necessary, you can use the
font size utilities
to control the heading’s appearance. All the following live examples use this approach.

Scrolling long content
When modals become too long for the user’s viewport or device, they scroll independent of the page itself. Try the demo below to see what we mean.
Modal title
This is some placeholder content to show the scrolling behavior for modals. Instead of repeating the text the modal, we use an inline style set a minimum height, thereby extending the length of the overall modal and demonstrating the overflow scrolling. When content becomes longer than the height of the viewport, scrolling will move the modal as needed.
Close
Save changes
Launch demo modal
You can also create a scrollable modal that allows scroll the modal body by adding
.modal-dialog-scrollable
.modal-dialog
Modal title
This is some placeholder content to show the scrolling behavior for modals. We use repeated line breaks to demonstrate how content can exceed minimum inner height, thereby showing inner scrolling. When content becomes longer than the predefined max-height of modal, content will be cropped and scrollable within the modal.
This content should appear at the bottom after you scroll.

Modal title
This is some placeholder content to show a vertically centered modal. We've added some extra copy here to show how vertically centering the modal works when combined with scrollable modals. We also use some repeated line breaks to quickly extend the height of the content, thereby triggering the scrolling. When content becomes longer than the predefined max-height of modal, content will be cropped and scrollable within the modal.
Just like that.

Using the grid
Utilize the Bootstrap grid system within a modal by nesting
.container-fluid
within the
.modal-body
. Then, use the normal grid system classes as you would anywhere else.

event.relatedTarget
HTML
data-bs-*
attributes
to vary the contents of the modal depending on which button was clicked.

Toggle between modals
Toggle between multiple modals with some clever placement of the
data-bs-target
data-bs-toggle
attributes. For example, you could toggle a password reset modal from within an already open sign in modal.
Please note multiple modals cannot be open at the same time
—this method simply toggles between two separate modals.

Change animation
$modal-fade-transform
variable determines the transform state of
.modal-dialog
before the modal fade-in animation, the
$modal-show-transform
variable determines the transform of
.modal-dialog
at the end of the modal fade-in animation.
If you want for example a zoom-in animation, you can set
$modal-fade-transform: scale(.8)
Remove animation
For modals that simply appear rather than fade in to view, remove the
.fade
class from your modal markup.
class
"modal"
tabindex
"-1"
aria-labelledby
"..."
aria-hidden
"true"
Dynamic heights
If the height of a modal changes while it is open, you should call
myModal.handleUpdate()
to readjust the modal’s position in case a scrollbar appears.
Accessibility
Be sure to add
aria-labelledby="..."
, referencing the modal title, to
.modal
. Additionally, you may give a description of your modal dialog with
aria-describedby
.modal
. Note that you don’t need to add
role="dialog"
since we already add it via JavaScript.
Embedding YouTube videos
Embedding YouTube videos in modals requires additional JavaScript not in Bootstrap to automatically stop playback and more.
See this helpful Stack Overflow post
for more information.
Optional sizes
Modals have three optional sizes, available via modifier classes to be placed on a
.modal-dialog
. These sizes kick in at certain breakpoints to avoid horizontal scrollbars on narrower viewports.

Variables
Added in v5.2.0
As part of Bootstrap’s evolving CSS variables approach, modals now use local CSS variables on
.modal
.modal-backdrop
for enhanced real-time customization. Values for the CSS variables are set via Sass, so Sass customization is still supported, too.

Usage
The modal plugin toggles your hidden content on demand, via data attributes or JavaScript. It also overrides default scrolling behavior and generates a
.modal-backdrop
to provide a click area for dismissing shown modals when clicking outside the modal.
Via data attributes
Toggle
Activate a modal without writing JavaScript. Set
data-bs-toggle="modal"
on a controller element, like a button, along with a
data-bs-target="#foo"
href="#foo"
to target a specific modal to toggle.
button
type
"button"
data-bs-toggle
"modal"
data-bs-target
"#myModal"
Launch modal
button
Dismiss
Dismissal can be achieved with the
data
attribute on a button
within the modal
as demonstrated below:
button
type
"button"
class
"btn-close"
data-bs-dismiss
"modal"
aria-label
"Close"
button
or on a button
outside the modal
using the
data-bs-target
as demonstrated below:
button
type
"button"
class
"btn-close"
data-bs-dismiss
"modal"
data-bs-target
"#my-modal"
aria-label
"Close"
button
While both ways to dismiss a modal are supported, keep in mind that dismissing from outside a modal does not match the
ARIA Authoring Practices Guide dialog (modal) pattern
. Do this at your own risk.
Via JavaScript
Create a modal with a single line of JavaScript:
const
myModal
Modal
document
getElementById
'myModal'
options
// or
const
myModalAlternative
Modal
'#myModal'
options
Options
As options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript, you can append an option name to
data-bs-
, as in
data-bs-animation="{value}"
. Make sure to change the case type of the option name from “
camelCase
” to “
kebab-case
” when passing the options via data attributes. For example, use
data-bs-custom-class="beautifier"
instead of
data-bs-customClass="beautifier"
As of Bootstrap 5.2.0, all components support an
experimental
reserved data attribute
data-bs-config
that can house simple component configuration as a JSON string. When an element has
data-bs-config='{"delay":0, "title":123}'
data-bs-title="456"
attributes, the final
title
value will be
and the separate data attributes will override values given on
data-bs-config
. In addition, existing data attributes are able to house JSON values like
data-bs-delay='{"show":0,"hide":150}'
Name
Type
Default
Description
backdrop
boolean,
'static'
true
Includes a modal-backdrop element. Alternatively, specify

Methods
Asynchronous methods and transitions
All API methods are
asynchronous
and start a
transition
. They return to the caller as soon as the transition is started but
before it ends
. In addition, a method call on a
transitioning component will be ignored
See our JavaScript documentation for more information
Passing options
Activates your content as a modal. Accepts an optional options
object
const
myModal
Modal
'#myModal'
keyboard
false
Method
Description
dispose
Destroys an element’s modal. (Removes stored data on the DOM element)
getInstance
Static
method which allows you to get the modal instance associated with a DOM element.
getOrCreateInstance
Static
method which allows you to get the modal instance associated with a DOM element, or create a new one in case it wasn’t initialized.
handleUpdate
Manually readjust the modal’s position if the height of a modal changes while it is open (i.e. in case a scrollbar appears).
hide
Manually hides a modal.
Returns to the caller before the modal has actually been hidden
(i.e. before the
hidden.bs.modal
event occurs).
show
Manually opens a modal.
Returns to the caller before the modal has actually been shown
(i.e. before the
shown.bs.modal
event occurs). Also, you can pass a DOM element as an argument that can be received in the modal events (as the
relatedTarget
property). (i.e.
const modalToggle = document.getElementById('toggleMyModal'); myModal.show(modalToggle)
toggle
Manually toggles a modal.
Returns to the caller before the modal has actually been shown or hidden
(i.e. before the
shown.bs.modal
hidden.bs.modal
event occurs).
Events
<div class="modal">
Event
Description
hide.bs.modal
This event is fired immediately when the
hide
instance method has been called.
hidden.bs.modal
This event is fired when the modal has finished being hidden from the user (will wait for CSS transitions to complete).
hidePrevented.bs.modal
This event is fired when the modal is shown, its backdrop is
static
and a click outside of the modal is performed. The event is also fired when the escape key is pressed and the
keyboard
option is set to
false
show.bs.modal
This event fires immediately when the
show
instance method is called. If caused by a click, the clicked element is available as the
relatedTarget
property of the event.
shown.bs.modal
This event is fired when the modal has been made visible to the user (will wait for CSS transitions to complete). If caused by a click, the clicked element is available as the
relatedTarget
property of the event.
