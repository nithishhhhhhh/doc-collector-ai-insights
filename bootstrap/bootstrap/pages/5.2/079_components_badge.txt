==================================================

Examples
Badges scale to match the size of the immediate parent element by using relative font sizing and
units. As of v5, badges no longer have focus or hover styles for links.

Buttons
Badges can be used as part of links or buttons to provide a counter.
Notifications

Note that depending on how they are used, badges may be confusing for users of screen readers and similar assistive technologies. While the styling of badges provides a visual cue as to their purpose, these users will simply be presented with the content of the badge. Depending on the specific situation, these badges may seem like random additional words or numbers at the end of a sentence, link, or button.
Unless the context is clear (as with the “Notifications” example, where it is understood that the “4” is the number of notifications), consider including additional context with a visually hidden piece of additional text.
Positioned
Use utilities to modify a
.badge
and position it in the corner of a link or button.
Inbox

button
type
"button"
class
"btn btn-primary position-relative"

You can also replace the
.badge
class with a few more utilities without a count for a more generic indicator.

Background colors
Added in v5.2.0
Set a
background-color
with contrasting foreground
color
with
.text-bg-{color}
helpers
. Previously it was required to manually pair your choice of
.text-{color}
.bg-{color}
utilities for styling, which you still may use if you prefer.

Conveying meaning to assistive technologies
Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies – such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the
.visually-hidden
class.
Pill badges
Use the
.rounded-pill
utility class to make badges more rounded with a larger
border-radius

Variables
Added in v5.2.0
As part of Bootstrap’s evolving CSS variables approach, badges now use local CSS variables on
.badge
for enhanced real-time customization. Values for the CSS variables are set via Sass, so Sass customization is still supported, too.
--#{$prefix}badge-padding-x
$badge-padding-x
--#{$prefix}badge-padding-y
$badge-padding-y
@include
$badge-font-size
$prefix
badge-font-size
--#{$prefix}badge-font-weight
$badge-font-weight
--#{$prefix}badge-color
$badge-color
--#{$prefix}badge-border-radius
$badge-border-radius
Sass variables
$badge-font-size
$badge-font-weight
$font-weight-bold
$badge-color
$white
