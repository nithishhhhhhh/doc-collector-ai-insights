property on the fly with four default values and classes. These classes are not responsive by default.

.overflow-auto
on an element with set width and height dimensions. By design, this content will vertically scroll.

.overflow-hidden
on an element with set width and height dimensions.
This is an example of using
.overflow-visible
on an element with set width and height dimensions.
This is an example of using

on an element with set width and height dimensions.
