About
Placeholders can be used to enhance the experience of your application. They’re built only with HTML and CSS, meaning you don’t need any JavaScript to create them. You will, however, need some custom JavaScript to toggle their visibility. Their appearance, color, and sizing can be easily customized with our utility classes.
Example
In the example below, we take a typical card component and recreate it with placeholders applied to create a “loading card”. Size and proportions are the same between the two.

How it works
Create placeholders with the
.placeholder
class and a grid column class (e.g.,
.col-6
) to set the
width
. They can replace the text inside an element or be added as a modifier class to an existing component.
We apply additional styling to
.btn
s via
::before
to ensure the
height
is respected. You may extend this pattern for other situations as needed, or add a
&nbsp;
within the element to reflect the height when actual text is rendered in its place.
html
aria-hidden
"true"
span
class
"placeholder col-6"
span
href
tabindex
"-1"
class
"btn btn-primary disabled placeholder col-4"
aria-hidden
"true"
The use of
aria-hidden="true"
only indicates that the element should be hidden to screen readers. The
loading
behavior of the placeholder depends on how authors will actually use the placeholder styles, how they plan to update things, etc. Some JavaScript code may be needed to
swap
the state of the placeholder and inform AT users of the update.
Width
You can change the
width
through grid column classes, width utilities, or inline styles.
html
span
class
"placeholder col-6"
span
span
class
"placeholder w-75"
span
span
class
"placeholder"
style
"width: 25%;"
span
Color
By default, the
placeholder
uses
currentColor
. This can be overridden with a custom color or utility class.
html
span
class
"placeholder col-12"
span
span
class
"placeholder col-12 bg-primary"
span
span
class
"placeholder col-12 bg-secondary"
span
span
class
"placeholder col-12 bg-success"
span
span
class
"placeholder col-12 bg-danger"
span
span
class
"placeholder col-12 bg-warning"
span
span
class
"placeholder col-12 bg-info"
span
span
class
"placeholder col-12 bg-light"
span
span
class
"placeholder col-12 bg-dark"
span
Sizing
The size of
.placeholder
s are based on the typographic style of the parent element. Customize them with sizing modifiers:
.placeholder-lg
.placeholder-sm
, or
.placeholder-xs
html
span
class
"placeholder col-12 placeholder-lg"

span
class
"placeholder col-12"

"placeholder col-12 placeholder-xs"

Animation
Animate placeholders with
.placeholder-glow
.placeholder-wave
to better convey the perception of something being
actively
loaded.
