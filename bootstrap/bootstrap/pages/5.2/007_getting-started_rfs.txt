==================================================

What is RFS?
is a unit resizing engine which was initially developed to resize font sizes (hence its abbreviation for Responsive Font Sizes). Nowadays RFS is capable of rescaling most CSS properties with unit values like
margin
padding
border-radius
, or even
box-shadow
The mechanism automatically calculates the appropriate values based on the dimensions of the browser viewport. It will be compiled into
calc()
functions with a mix of
and viewport units to enable the responsive scaling behavior.
Using RFS
The mixins are included in Bootstrap and are available once you include Bootstrap’s
scss
. RFS can also be
installed standalone
if needed.
Using the mixins
rfs()
mixin has shorthands for
font-size
margin
margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left
padding
padding-top
padding-right
padding-bottom
, and
padding-left
. See the example below for source Sass and compiled CSS.
.title
@include
font-size
title
font-size
calc
1.525
media
min-width
1200px
title
font-size
Any other property can be passed to the
rfs()
mixin like this:
.selector
@include
border-radius
!important
can also just be added to whatever value you want:
.selector
@include
padding
!important
Using the functions
When you don’t want to use the includes, there are also two functions:
rfs-value()
converts a value into a
value if a
value is passed, in other cases it returns the same result.
rfs-fluid-value()
returns the fluid version of a value if the property needs rescaling.
In this example, we use one of Bootstrap’s built-in
responsive breakpoint mixins
to only apply styling below the
breakpoint.
.selector
@include
media-breakpoint-down
padding
rfs-fluid-value
font-size
rfs-fluid-value
.125
media
max-width
98px
selector
padding
calc
1.325
font-size
1.125
/* 1.125rem is small enough, so RFS won't rescale this */
Extended documentation
RFS is a separate project under the Bootstrap organization. More about RFS and its configuration can be found on its
