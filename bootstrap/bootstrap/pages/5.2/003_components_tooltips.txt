==================================================

Overview
Things to know when using the tooltip plugin:
Tooltips rely on the third party library
Popper
for positioning. You must include
popper.min.js
before
, or use one
which contains Popper.
Tooltips are opt-in for performance reasons, so
you must initialize them yourself
Tooltips with zero-length titles are never displayed.
Specify
container: 'body'
to avoid rendering problems in more complex components (like our input groups, button groups, etc).
Triggering tooltips on hidden elements will not work.
Tooltips for
.disabled
disabled
elements must be triggered on a wrapper element.
When triggered from hyperlinks that span multiple lines, tooltips will be centered. Use
white-space: nowrap;
on your
s to avoid this behavior.
Tooltips must be hidden before their corresponding elements have been removed from the DOM.
Tooltips can be triggered thanks to an element inside a shadow DOM.
Got all that? Great, let’s see how they work with some examples.
By default, this component uses the built-in content sanitizer, which strips out any HTML elements that are not explicitly allowed. See the
sanitizer section in our JavaScript documentation
for more details.
The animation effect of this component is dependent on the
prefers-reduced-motion
media query. See the
reduced motion section of our accessibility documentation
Examples
Enable tooltips
As mentioned above, you must initialize tooltips before they can be used. One way to initialize all tooltips on a page would be to select them by their
data-bs-toggle
attribute, like so:
const
tooltipTriggerList
document
querySelectorAll
'[data-bs-toggle="tooltip"]'
const
tooltipList
[...
tooltipTriggerList
tooltipTriggerEl
Tooltip
tooltipTriggerEl
Tooltips on links
Hover over the links below to see tooltips:
Placeholder text to demonstrate some
inline links
with tooltips. This is now just filler, no killer. Content placed here just to mimic the presence of
real text
. And all that just to give you an idea of how tooltips would look when used in real-world situations. So hopefully you've now seen how
these tooltips on links
can work in practice, once you use them on
your own
site or project.

your own
site or project.
Feel free to use either
title
data-bs-title
in your HTML. When
title
is used, Popper will replace it automatically with
data-bs-title
when the element is rendered.
Custom tooltips
Added in v5.2.0
You can customize the appearance of tooltips using
CSS variables
. We set a custom class with
data-bs-custom-class="custom-tooltip"
to scope our custom appearance and use it to override a local CSS variable.
.custom-tooltip
--bs-tooltip-bg
bs-primary

Variables
Added in v5.2.0
As part of Bootstrap’s evolving CSS variables approach, tooltips now use local CSS variables on
.tooltip
for enhanced real-time customization. Values for the CSS variables are set via Sass, so Sass customization is still supported, too.

$zindex-tooltip
--#{$prefix}tooltip-max-width
$tooltip-max-width
--#{$prefix}tooltip-padding-x

Usage
The tooltip plugin generates content and markup on demand, and by default places tooltips after their trigger element.
Trigger the tooltip via JavaScript:
const
exampleEl
document
getElementById
'example'
const
tooltip
Tooltip
exampleEl
options
Overflow
auto
scroll
Tooltip position attempts to automatically change when a
parent container
overflow: auto
overflow: scroll
like our
.table-responsive
, but still keeps the original placement’s positioning. To resolve this, set the
boundary
option
(for the flip modifier using the
popperConfig
option) to any HTMLElement to override the default value,
'clippingParents'
, such as
document.body
const
tooltip
Tooltip
'#example'
boundary
document
body
// or document.querySelector('#boundary')
Markup
The required markup for a tooltip is only a
data
attribute and
title
on the HTML element you wish to have a tooltip. The generated markup of a tooltip is rather simple, though it does require a position (by default, set to
by the plugin).
Making tooltips work for keyboard and assistive technology users
You should only add tooltips to HTML elements that are traditionally keyboard-focusable and interactive (such as links or form controls). Although arbitrary HTML elements (such as
<span>
s) can be made focusable by adding the
tabindex="0"
attribute, this will add potentially annoying and confusing tab stops on non-interactive elements for keyboard users, and most assistive technologies currently do not announce the tooltip in this situation. Additionally, do not rely solely on
hover
as the trigger for your tooltip, as this will make your tooltips impossible to trigger for keyboard users.
<!-- HTML to write -->
href
data-bs-toggle
"tooltip"
data-bs-title
"Some tooltip text!"
Hover over me
<!-- Generated markup by the plugin -->
class
"tooltip bs-tooltip-top"
role
"tooltip"
class
"tooltip-arrow"
class
"tooltip-inner"
Some tooltip text!
Disabled elements
Elements with the
disabled
attribute aren’t interactive, meaning users cannot focus, hover, or click them to trigger a tooltip (or popover). As a workaround, you’ll want to trigger the tooltip from a wrapper
<div>
<span>
, ideally made keyboard-focusable using
tabindex="0"
Disabled button
html
span
class
"d-inline-block"
tabindex
data-bs-toggle
"tooltip"
data-bs-title
"Disabled tooltip"
button
class
"btn btn-primary"
type
"button"
disabled
Disabled button
button
span
Options
As options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript, you can append an option name to
data-bs-
, as in
data-bs-animation="{value}"
. Make sure to change the case type of the option name from “
camelCase
” to “
kebab-case
” when passing the options via data attributes. For example, use
data-bs-custom-class="beautifier"
instead of
data-bs-customClass="beautifier"
As of Bootstrap 5.2.0, all components support an
experimental
reserved data attribute
data-bs-config
that can house simple component configuration as a JSON string. When an element has
data-bs-config='{"delay":0, "title":123}'
data-bs-title="456"
attributes, the final
title
value will be
and the separate data attributes will override values given on
data-bs-config
. In addition, existing data attributes are able to house JSON values like
data-bs-delay='{"show":0,"hide":150}'
Note that for security reasons the
sanitize
sanitizeFn
, and
allowList
options cannot be supplied using data attributes.
Name
Type
Default
Description
allowList
object
Default value
Object which contains allowed attributes and tags.
animation
boolean
true
Apply a CSS fade transition to the tooltip.
boundary
string, element
'clippingParents'
Overflow constraint boundary of the tooltip (applies only to Popper’s preventOverflow modifier). By default, it’s
'clippingParents'
and can accept an HTMLElement reference (via JavaScript only). For more information refer to Popper’s
detectOverflow docs
container
string, element, false
false
Appends the tooltip to a specific element. Example:
container: 'body'
. This option is particularly useful in that it allows you to position the tooltip in the flow of the document near the triggering element - which will prevent the tooltip from floating away from the triggering element during a window resize.
customClass
string, function
Add classes to the tooltip when it is shown. Note that these classes will be added in addition to any classes specified in the template. To add multiple classes, separate them with spaces:
'class-1 class-2'
. You can also pass a function that should return a single string containing additional class names.
delay
number, object
Delay showing and hiding the tooltip (ms)—doesn’t apply to manual trigger type. If a number is supplied, delay is applied to both hide/show. Object structure is:
delay: { "show": 500, "hide": 100 }
fallbackPlacements
array
['top', 'right', 'bottom', 'left']
Define fallback placements by providing a list of placements in array (in order of preference). For more information refer to Popper’s
behavior docs
html
boolean
false
Allow HTML in the tooltip. If true, HTML tags in the tooltip’s
title
will be rendered in the tooltip. If false,
innerText
property will be used to insert content into the DOM. Use text if you’re worried about XSS attacks.
offset
array, string, function
[0, 0]
Offset of the tooltip relative to its target. You can pass a string in data attributes with comma separated values like:
data-bs-offset="10,20"
. When a function is used to determine the offset, it is called with an object containing the popper placement, the reference, and popper rects as its first argument. The triggering element DOM node is passed as the second argument. The function must return an array with two numbers:
skidding
distance
. For more information refer to Popper’s
offset docs
placement
string, function
'top'
How to position the tooltip: auto, top, bottom, left, right. When
auto
is specified, it will dynamically reorient the tooltip. When a function is used to determine the placement, it is called with the tooltip DOM node as its first argument and the triggering element DOM node as its second. The
this
context is set to the tooltip instance.
popperConfig
null, object, function
null
To change Bootstrap’s default Popper config, see
Popper’s configuration
. When a function is used to create the Popper configuration, it’s called with an object that contains the Bootstrap’s default Popper configuration. It helps you use and merge the default with your own configuration. The function must return a configuration object for Popper.
sanitize
boolean
true
Enable or disable the sanitization. If activated
'template'
'content'
'title'
options will be sanitized.
sanitizeFn
null, function
null
Here you can supply your own sanitize function. This can be useful if you prefer to use a dedicated library to perform sanitization.
selector
string, false
false
If a selector is provided, tooltip objects will be delegated to the specified targets. In practice, this is used to also apply tooltips to dynamically added DOM elements (
jQuery.on
support). See
this issue
an informative example
Note
title
attribute must not be used as a selector.
template
string
'<div class="tooltip" role="tooltip"><div class="tooltip-arrow"></div><div class="tooltip-inner"></div></div>'
Base HTML to use when creating the tooltip. The tooltip’s
title
will be injected into the
.tooltip-inner
.tooltip-arrow
will become the tooltip’s arrow. The outermost wrapper element should have the
.tooltip
class and
role="tooltip"
title
string, element, function
Default title value if
title
attribute isn’t present. If a function is given, it will be called with its
this
reference set to the element that the popover is attached to.
trigger
string
'hover focus'
How tooltip is triggered: click, hover, focus, manual. You may pass multiple triggers; separate them with a space.
'manual'
indicates that the tooltip will be triggered programmatically via the
.tooltip('show')
.tooltip('hide')
.tooltip('toggle')
methods; this value cannot be combined with any other trigger.
'hover'
on its own will result in tooltips that cannot be triggered via the keyboard, and should only be used if alternative methods for conveying the same information for keyboard users is present.
Data attributes for individual tooltips
Options for individual tooltips can alternatively be specified through the use of data attributes, as explained above.
Using function with
popperConfig
const
tooltip

popperConfig
defaultBsPopperConfig
// const newPopperConfig = {...}
// use defaultBsPopperConfig if needed...
// return newPopperConfig
Methods
Asynchronous methods and transitions
All API methods are
asynchronous
and start a
transition
. They return to the caller as soon as the transition is started but
before it ends
. In addition, a method call on a
transitioning component will be ignored
See our JavaScript documentation for more information
Method
Description
disable
Removes the ability for an element’s tooltip to be shown. The tooltip will only be able to be shown if it is re-enabled.
dispose
Hides and destroys an element’s tooltip (Removes stored data on the DOM element). Tooltips that use delegation (which are created using
selector
option
) cannot be individually destroyed on descendant trigger elements.
enable
Gives an element’s tooltip the ability to be shown.
Tooltips are enabled by default.
getInstance
Static
method which allows you to get the tooltip instance associated with a DOM element, or create a new one in case it wasn’t initialized.
getOrCreateInstance
Static
method which allows you to get the tooltip instance associated with a DOM element, or create a new one in case it wasn’t initialized.
hide
Hides an element’s tooltip.
Returns to the caller before the tooltip has actually been hidden
(i.e. before the
hidden.bs.tooltip
event occurs). This is considered a “manual” triggering of the tooltip.
setContent
Gives a way to change the tooltip’s content after its initialization.
show
Reveals an element’s tooltip.
Returns to the caller before the tooltip has actually been shown
(i.e. before the
shown.bs.tooltip
event occurs). This is considered a “manual” triggering of the tooltip. Tooltips with zero-length titles are never displayed.
toggle
Toggles an element’s tooltip.
Returns to the caller before the tooltip has actually been shown or hidden
(i.e. before the
shown.bs.tooltip
hidden.bs.tooltip
event occurs). This is considered a “manual” triggering of the tooltip.
toggleEnabled
Toggles the ability for an element’s tooltip to be shown or hidden.
update
Updates the position of an element’s tooltip.
const

This event is fired after the
show.bs.tooltip
event when the tooltip template has been added to the DOM.
show.bs.tooltip
This event fires immediately when the
show
instance method is called.
