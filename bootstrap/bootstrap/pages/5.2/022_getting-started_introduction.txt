==================================================

Quick start
Get started by including Bootstrap’s production-ready CSS and JavaScript via CDN without the need for any build steps. See it in practice with this
Create a new
index.html
file in your project root.
Include the
<meta name="viewport">
tag as well for
proper responsive behavior
in mobile devices.

Include Bootstrap’s CSS and JS.
Place the
<link>
tag in the
<head>
for our CSS, and the
<script>
tag for our JavaScript bundle (including Popper for positioning dropdowns, poppers, and tooltips) before the closing
</body>
. Learn more about our

You can also include

and our JS separately. If you don’t plan to use dropdowns, popovers, or tooltips, save some kilobytes by not including Popper.

Hello, world!
Open the page in your browser of choice to see your Bootstrapped page. Now you can start building with Bootstrap by creating your own
layout
, adding dozens of
components
, and utilizing
our official examples
CDN links
As reference, here are our primary CDN links.
Description
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js
You can also use the CDN to fetch any of our
additional builds listed in the Contents page
Next steps
Read a bit more about some
important global environment settings
that Bootstrap utilizes.
Read about what’s included in Bootstrap in our
contents section
and the list of
components that require JavaScript
below.
Need a little more power? Consider building with Bootstrap by
including the source files via package manager
Looking to use Bootstrap as a module with
<script type="module">
? Please refer to our
using Bootstrap as a module
section.
JS components
Curious which components explicitly require our JavaScript and Popper? Click the show components link below. If you’re at all unsure about the general page structure, keep reading for an example page template.
Show components requiring JavaScript
Alerts for dismissing
Buttons for toggling states and checkbox/radio functionality
Carousel for all slide behaviors, controls, and indicators
Collapse for toggling visibility of content
Dropdowns for displaying and positioning (also requires
Popper
Modals for displaying, positioning, and scroll behavior
Navbar for extending our Collapse and Offcanvas plugins to implement responsive behaviors
Navs with the Tab plugin for toggling content panes
Offcanvases for displaying, positioning, and scroll behavior
Scrollspy for scroll behavior and navigation updates
Toasts for displaying and dismissing
Tooltips and popovers for displaying and positioning (also requires
Popper

Responsive meta tag
mobile first
, a strategy in which we optimize code for mobile devices first and then scale up components as necessary using CSS media queries. To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming for all devices, add the responsive viewport meta tag to your
<head>
meta
name
"viewport"
content
"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"
You can see an example of this in action in the
quick start
Box-sizing
For more straightforward sizing in CSS, we switch the global
box-sizing
value from
content-box
border-box
. This ensures
padding
does not affect the final computed width of an element, but it can cause problems with some third-party software like Google Maps and Google Custom Search Engine.
On the rare occasion you need to override it, use something like the following:
selector-for-some-widget
box-sizing
content-box
With the above snippet, nested elements—including generated content via
::before
::after
—will all inherit the specified
box-sizing
for that
.selector-for-some-widget

box model and sizing at CSS Tricks
Reboot
For improved cross-browser rendering, we use
Reboot
to correct inconsistencies across browsers and devices while providing slightly more opinionated resets to common HTML elements.
