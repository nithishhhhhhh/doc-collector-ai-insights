Source files
Compile Bootstrap with your own asset pipeline by downloading our source Sass, JavaScript, and documentation files. This option requires some additional tooling:
Sass compiler
for compiling Sass source files into CSS files
Autoprefixer
for CSS vendor prefixing

build tools
, they are included for developing Bootstrap and its docs, but they’re likely unsuitable for your own purposes.

const bootstrap = require('bootstrap')
import bootstrap from 'bootstrap'
will load all of Bootstrap’s plugins onto a
object.
module itself exports all of our plugins. You can manually load Bootstrap’s plugins individually by loading the
/js/dist/*.js
files under the package’s top-level directory.
package.json
