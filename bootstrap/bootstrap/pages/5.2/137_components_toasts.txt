==================================================

Toasts are lightweight notifications designed to mimic the push notifications that have been popularized by mobile and desktop operating systems. They’re built with flexbox, so they’re easy to align and position.
Overview
Things to know when using the toast plugin:
Toasts are opt-in for performance reasons, so
you must initialize them yourself
Toasts will automatically hide if you do not specify
autohide: false
The animation effect of this component is dependent on the
prefers-reduced-motion
media query. See the
reduced motion section of our accessibility documentation
Examples
Basic
To encourage extensible and predictable toasts, we recommend a header and body. Toast headers use
display: flex
, allowing easy alignment of content thanks to our margin and flexbox utilities.
Toasts are as flexible as you need and have very little required markup. At a minimum, we require a single element to contain your “toasted” content and strongly encourage a dismiss button.

Hello, world! This is a toast message.
Previously, our scripts dynamically added the
.hide
class to completely hide a toast (with
display:none
, rather than just with
opacity:0
). This is now not necessary anymore. However, for backwards compatibility, our script will continue to toggle the class (even though there is no practical need for it) until the next major version.
Live example
Click the button below to show a toast (positioned with our utilities in the lower right corner) that has been hidden by default.

Stacking
You can stack toasts by wrapping them in a toast container, which will vertically add some spacing.

Custom content
Customize your toasts by removing sub-components, tweaking them with
utilities
, or by adding your own markup. Here we’ve created a simpler toast by removing the default
.toast-header
, adding a custom hide icon from
, and using some
flexbox utilities
to adjust the layout.

Color schemes

utilities. Here we’ve added
.text-bg-primary
to the
.toast
, and then added
.btn-close-white
to our close button. For a crisp edge, we remove the default border with
.border-0

Accessibility
Toasts are intended to be small interruptions to your visitors or users, so to help those with screen readers and similar assistive technologies, you should wrap your toasts in an
aria-live
region
. Changes to live regions (such as injecting/updating a toast component) are automatically announced by screen readers without needing to move the user’s focus or otherwise interrupt the user. Additionally, include
aria-atomic="true"
to ensure that the entire toast is always announced as a single (atomic) unit, rather than just announcing what was changed (which could lead to problems if you only update part of the toast’s content, or if displaying the same toast content at a later point in time). If the information needed is important for the process, e.g. for a list of errors in a form, then use the
alert component
instead of toast.
Note that the live region needs to be present in the markup
before
the toast is generated or updated. If you dynamically generate both at the same time and inject them into the page, they will generally not be announced by assistive technologies.
You also need to adapt the
role
aria-live
level depending on the content. If it’s an important message like an error, use
role="alert" aria-live="assertive"
, otherwise use
role="status" aria-live="polite"
attributes.
As the content you’re displaying changes, be sure to update the
delay
timeout
so that users have enough time to read the toast.

data-bs-delay

When using
autohide: false
, you must add a close button to allow users to dismiss the toast.

Hello, world! This is a toast message.
While technically it’s possible to add focusable/actionable controls (such as additional buttons or links) in your toast, you should avoid doing this for autohiding toasts. Even if you give the toast a long
delay
timeout
, keyboard and assistive technology users may find it difficult to reach the toast in time to take action (since toasts don’t receive focus when they are displayed). If you absolutely must have further controls, we recommend using a toast with
autohide: false
Variables
Added in v5.2.0
As part of Bootstrap’s evolving CSS variables approach, toasts now use local CSS variables on
.toast
for enhanced real-time customization. Values for the CSS variables are set via Sass, so Sass customization is still supported, too.

Usage
Initialize toasts via JavaScript:
const
toastElList
document
querySelectorAll
'.toast'
const
toastList
[...
toastElList
toastEl
Toast
toastEl
option
Triggers
Dismissal can be achieved with the
data
attribute on a button
within the toast
as demonstrated below:
button
type
"button"
class
"btn-close"
data-bs-dismiss
"toast"
aria-label
"Close"
button
or on a button
outside the toast
using the
data-bs-target
as demonstrated below:
button
type
"button"
class
"btn-close"
data-bs-dismiss
"toast"
data-bs-target
"#my-toast"
aria-label
"Close"
button
Options
As options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript, you can append an option name to
data-bs-
, as in
data-bs-animation="{value}"
. Make sure to change the case type of the option name from “
camelCase
” to “
kebab-case
” when passing the options via data attributes. For example, use
data-bs-custom-class="beautifier"
instead of
data-bs-customClass="beautifier"
As of Bootstrap 5.2.0, all components support an
experimental
reserved data attribute
data-bs-config
that can house simple component configuration as a JSON string. When an element has
data-bs-config='{"delay":0, "title":123}'
data-bs-title="456"
attributes, the final
title
value will be
and the separate data attributes will override values given on
data-bs-config
. In addition, existing data attributes are able to house JSON values like
data-bs-delay='{"show":0,"hide":150}'
Name
Type
Default
Description
animation
boolean
true
Apply a CSS fade transition to the toast.
autohide
boolean
true
Automatically hide the toast after the delay.
delay
number
5000
Delay in milliseconds before hiding the toast.
Methods
Asynchronous methods and transitions
All API methods are
asynchronous
and start a
transition
. They return to the caller as soon as the transition is started but
before it ends
. In addition, a method call on a
transitioning component will be ignored
See our JavaScript documentation for more information
Method
Description
dispose
Hides an element’s toast. Your toast will remain on the DOM but won’t show anymore.
getInstance
Static
method which allows you to get the toast instance associated with a DOM element.
For example:
const myToastEl = document.getElementById('myToastEl')
const myToast = bootstrap.Toast.getInstance(myToastEl)
Returns a Bootstrap toast instance.
getOrCreateInstance
Static
method which allows you to get the toast instance associated with a DOM element, or create a new one, in case it wasn’t initialized.
const myToastEl = document.getElementById('myToastEl')
const myToast = bootstrap.Toast.getOrCreateInstance(myToastEl)
Returns a Bootstrap toast instance.
hide
Hides an element’s toast.
Returns to the caller before the toast has actually been hidden
(i.e. before the
hidden.bs.toast
event occurs). You have to manually call this method if you made
autohide
false
isShown
Returns a boolean according to toast’s visibility state.
show
Reveals an element’s toast.
Returns to the caller before the toast has actually been shown
(i.e. before the
shown.bs.toast
event occurs). You have to manually call this method, instead your toast won’t show.
Events

Description
hide.bs.toast
This event is fired immediately when the
hide
instance method has been called.
hidden.bs.toast
This event is fired when the toast has finished being hidden from the user.
show.bs.toast
This event fires immediately when the
show
instance method is called.
shown.bs.toast
