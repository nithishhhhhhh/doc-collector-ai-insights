==================================================

Visually hide an element while still allowing it to be exposed to assistive technologies (such as screen readers) with
.visually-hidden
. Use
.visually-hidden-focusable
to visually hide an element by default, but to display it when it’s focused (e.g. by a keyboard-only user).
.visually-hidden-focusable
can also be applied to a container–thanks to
:focus-within
, the container will be displayed when any child element of the container receives focus.
