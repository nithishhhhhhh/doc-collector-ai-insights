==================================================

Overview
Color and background helpers combine the power of our
.text-*
utilities
.bg-*
utilities
in one class. Using our Sass
color-contrast()
function, we automatically determine a contrasting
color
for a particular
background-color
Heads up!
There’s currently no support for a CSS-native
color-contrast
function, so we use our own via Sass. This means that customizing our theme colors via CSS variables may cause color contrast issues with these utilities.

Accessibility tip:
Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies like screen readers. Please ensure the meaning is obvious from the content itself (e.g., the visible text with a
sufficient
color contrast
) or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the
.visually-hidden
class.
With components
Use them in place of combined
.text-*
.bg-*
classes, like on
