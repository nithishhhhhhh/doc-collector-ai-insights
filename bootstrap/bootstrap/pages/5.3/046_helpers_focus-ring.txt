==================================================

.focus-ring
helper removes the default
outline
:focus
, replacing it with a
box-shadow
that can be more broadly customized. The new shadow is made up of a series of CSS variables, inherited from the
:root
level, that can be modified for any element or component.

.focus-ring
sets styles via global CSS variables that can be overridden on any parent element, as shown above. These variables are generated from their Sass variable counterparts.
scss/_root.scss
#{$prefix}
focus-ring-width
#{$focus-ring-width}
#{$prefix}
focus-ring-opacity
#{$focus-ring-opacity}
#{$prefix}
focus-ring-color
#{$focus-ring-color}
By default, there is no
--bs-focus-ring-x
--bs-focus-ring-y
, or
--bs-focus-ring-blur
, but we provide CSS variables with fallbacks to initial
values. Modify them to change the default appearance.
