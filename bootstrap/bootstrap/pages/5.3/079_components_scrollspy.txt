==================================================

How it works
Scrollspy toggles the
.active
class on anchor (
) elements when the element with the
referenced by the anchor’s
href
is scrolled into view. Scrollspy is best used in conjunction with a Bootstrap
nav component
list group
, but it will also work with any anchor elements in the current page. Here’s how it works.
To start, scrollspy requires two things: a navigation, list group, or a simple set of links, plus a scrollable container. The scrollable container can be the
<body>
or a custom element with a set
height
overflow-y: scroll
On the scrollable container, add
data-bs-spy="scroll"
data-bs-target="#navId"
where
navId
is the unique
of the associated navigation. If there is no focusable element inside the element, be sure to also include a
tabindex="0"
to ensure keyboard access.
As you scroll the “spied” container, an
.active
class is added and removed from anchor links within the associated navigation. Links must have resolvable
targets, otherwise they’re ignored. For example, a
<a href="#home">home</a>
must correspond to something in the DOM like
<div id="home"></div>
Target elements that are not visible will be ignored. See the
Non-visible elements
section below.
Examples
Navbar
Scroll the area below the navbar and watch the active class change. Open the dropdown menu and watch the dropdown items be highlighted as well.
First heading
This is some placeholder content for the scrollspy page. Note that as you scroll down the page, the appropriate navigation link is highlighted. It’s repeated throughout the component example. We keep adding some more example copy here to emphasize the scrolling and highlighting.

Nested nav
Scrollspy also works with nested

s. If a nested

.active
, its parents will also be

Non-visible elements
Target elements that aren’t visible will be ignored and their corresponding nav items won’t receive an
.active
class. Scrollspy instances initialized in a non-visible wrapper will ignore all target elements. Use the
refresh
method to check for observable elements once the wrapper becomes visible.

Usage
Via data attributes
To easily add scrollspy behavior to your topbar navigation, add
data-bs-spy="scroll"
to the element you want to spy on (most typically this would be the
<body>
). Then add the
data-bs-target
attribute with the
or class name of the parent element of any Bootstrap
.nav
component.

Via JavaScript

target

Options
As options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript, you can append an option name to
data-bs-
, as in
data-bs-animation="{value}"
. Make sure to change the case type of the option name from “
camelCase
” to “
kebab-case
” when passing the options via data attributes. For example, use
data-bs-custom-class="beautifier"
instead of
data-bs-customClass="beautifier"
As of Bootstrap 5.2.0, all components support an
experimental
reserved data attribute
data-bs-config
that can house simple component configuration as a JSON string. When an element has
data-bs-config='{"delay":0, "title":123}'
data-bs-title="456"
attributes, the final
title
value will be
and the separate data attributes will override values given on
data-bs-config
. In addition, existing data attributes are able to house JSON values like
data-bs-delay='{"show":0,"hide":150}'
The final configuration object is the merged result of
data-bs-config
data-bs-
, and
js object
where the latest given key-value overrides the others.

Deprecated Options
Up until v5.1.3 we were using

rootMargin
To keep backwards compatibility, we will continue to parse a given

Methods
Method
Description
dispose
Destroys an element’s scrollspy. (Removes stored data on the DOM element)
getInstance
Static
method to get the scrollspy instance associated with a DOM element.
getOrCreateInstance
Static
method to get the scrollspy instance associated with a DOM element, or to create a new one in case it wasn’t initialized.
refresh
When adding or removing elements in the DOM, you’ll need to call the refresh method.
Here’s an example using the refresh method:
const
dataSpyList
document
querySelectorAll
'[data-bs-spy="scroll"]'
dataSpyList
forEach
dataSpyEl
ScrollSpy
getInstance
dataSpyEl
refresh
Events
Event

addEventListener
'activate.bs.scrollspy'
// do something...
