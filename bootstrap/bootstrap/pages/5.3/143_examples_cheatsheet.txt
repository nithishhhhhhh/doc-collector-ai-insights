A well-known quote, contained in a blockquote element.
This is a list.
It appears completely unstyled.
Structurally, it's still a list.
However, this style only applies to immediate child elements.
Nested lists:
are unaffected by this style
will still show a bullet
and have appropriate left margin
This may still come in handy in some situations.
This is a list item.
And another one.
But they're displayed inline.

Accordion
Documentation
Accordion Item #1
This is the first item's accordion body.
It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the
.accordion-body
, though the transition does limit overflow.
Accordion Item #2
This is the second item's accordion body.
It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the
.accordion-body
, though the transition does limit overflow.
Accordion Item #3
This is the third item's accordion body.

Aww yeah, you successfully read this important alert message. This example text is going to run a bit longer so that you can see how spacing within an alert works with this kind of content.
Whenever you need to, be sure to use margin utilities to keep things nice and tidy.
