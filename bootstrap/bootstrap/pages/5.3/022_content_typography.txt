Global settings
textual utility classes
Use a
native font stack
that selects the best
font-family
for each OS and device.
For a more inclusive and accessible type scale, we use the browser’s default root
font-size
(typically 16px) so visitors can customize their browser defaults as needed.
Use the
$font-family-base
$font-size-base
, and
$line-height-base
attributes as our typographic base applied to the
<body>
Set the global link color via
$link-color
$body-bg
to set a
background-color
on the
<body>
#fff
by default).
These styles can be found within
_reboot.scss
, and the global variables are defined in
_variables.scss
. Make sure to set
$font-size-base

Display headings
Traditional heading elements are designed to work best in the meat of your page content. When you need a heading to stand out, consider using a
display heading
—a larger, slightly more opinionated heading style.

Inline text elements
Styling for common inline HTML5 elements.
You can use the mark tag to
highlight
text.
This line of text is meant to be treated as deleted text.
This line of text is meant to be treated as no longer accurate.
This line of text is meant to be treated as an addition to the document.
This line of text will render as underlined.
This line of text is meant to be treated as fine print.
This line rendered as bold text.
This line rendered as italicized text.

Beware that those tags should be used for semantic purpose:
<mark>
represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation purposes.
<small>
represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text.
represents element that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate.
represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation.
If you want to style your text, you should use the following classes instead:
.mark
will apply the same styles as
<mark>
.small
will apply the same styles as
<small>
.text-decoration-underline
will apply the same styles as
.text-decoration-line-through
will apply the same styles as

Abbreviations
Stylized implementation of HTML’s
<abbr>
element for abbreviations and acronyms to show the expanded version on hover. Abbreviations have a default underline and gain a help cursor to provide additional context on hover and to users of assistive technologies.

Blockquotes
For quoting blocks of content from another source within your document. Wrap
<blockquote class="blockquote">
around any HTML as the quote.

Naming a source
The HTML spec requires that blockquote attribution be placed outside the
<blockquote>
. When providing attribution, wrap your
<blockquote>
in a
<figure>
and use a
<figcaption>
or a block level element (e.g.,
) with the
.blockquote-footer
class. Be sure to wrap the name of the source work in
<cite>
as well.

Lists
Unstyled
Remove the default
list-style
and left margin on list items (immediate children only).
This only applies to immediate children list items
, meaning you will need to add the class for any nested lists as well.
This is a list.
It appears completely unstyled.
Structurally, it’s still a list.
However, this style only applies to immediate child elements.
Nested lists:
are unaffected by this style
will still show a bullet
and have appropriate left margin
This may still come in handy in some situations.

Inline
Remove a list’s bullets and apply some light
margin
with a combination of two classes,
.list-inline
.list-inline-item
This is a list item.
And another one.
But they’re displayed inline.

Description list alignment
Align terms and descriptions horizontally by using our grid system’s predefined classes (or semantic mixins). For longer terms, you can optionally add a
.text-truncate
class to truncate the text with an ellipsis.
Description lists
A description list is perfect for defining terms.
Term
Definition for the term.
And some more placeholder definition text.
Another term
This definition is short, so no extra paragraphs or anything.
Truncated term is truncated
This can be useful when space is tight. Adds an ellipsis at the end.

I heard you like definition lists. Let me put a definition list inside your definition list.

Responsive font sizes
In Bootstrap 5, we’ve enabled responsive font sizes by default, allowing text to scale more naturally across device and viewport sizes. Have a look at the
RFS page
to find out how this works.
Sass variables
Headings have some dedicated variables for sizing and spacing.
scss/_variables.scss
$headings-margin-bottom
$spacer
$headings-font-family
null
$headings-font-style
null
$headings-font-weight
$headings-line-height

also have dedicated variables.
