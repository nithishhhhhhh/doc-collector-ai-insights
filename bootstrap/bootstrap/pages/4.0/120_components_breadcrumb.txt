Accessibility
Since breadcrumbs provide a navigation, it’s a good idea to add a meaningful label such as
aria-label="breadcrumb"
to describe the type of navigation provided in the
<nav>
element, as well as applying an
aria-current="page"
to the last item of the set to indicate that it represents the current page.
