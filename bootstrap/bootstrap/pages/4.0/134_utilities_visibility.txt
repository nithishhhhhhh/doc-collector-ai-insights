Visibility
Control the visibility, without modifying the display, of elements with visibility utilities.
Set the
visibility
of elements with our visibility utilities. These do not modify the
display
value at all and are helpful for hiding content from most users, but still keeping them for screen readers.
Apply
.visible
.invisible
