Alerts
Provide contextual feedback messages for typical user actions with the handful of available and flexible alert messages.
Examples
Alerts are available for any length of text, as well as an optional dismiss button. For proper styling, use one of the eight
required
contextual classes (e.g.,
.alert-success
). For inline dismissal, use the
alerts jQuery plugin

Conveying meaning to assistive technologies
Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies – such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the
.sr-only
class.
Link color
Use the
.alert-link
utility class to quickly provide matching colored links within any alert.

Additional content
Alerts can also contain additional HTML elements like headings, paragraphs and dividers.
Well done!
Aww yeah, you successfully read this important alert message. This example text is going to run a bit longer so that you can see how spacing within an alert works with this kind of content.
Whenever you need to, be sure to use margin utilities to keep things nice and tidy.

Dismissing
Using the alert JavaScript plugin, it’s possible to dismiss any alert inline. Here’s how:
Be sure you’ve loaded the alert plugin, or the compiled Bootstrap JavaScript.
If you’re building our JavaScript from source, it
requires
util.js
. The compiled version includes this.
Add a dismiss button and the
.alert-dismissible
class, which adds extra padding to the right of the alert and positions the
.close
button.
On the dismiss button, add the
data-dismiss="alert"
attribute, which triggers the JavaScript functionality. Be sure to use the
<button>
element with it for proper behavior across all devices.
To animate alerts when dismissing them, be sure to add the
.fade
.show
classes.
You can see this in action with a live demo:
Holy guacamole!
You should check in on some of those fields below.
<div
class=
"alert alert-warning alert-dismissible fade show"
role=
"alert"
<strong>
Holy guacamole!
</strong>
You should check in on some of those fields below.
<button
type=
"button"
class=
"close"
data-dismiss=
"alert"
aria-label=
"Close"
<span
aria-hidden=
"true"
&times;
</span>
</button>
</div>
JavaScript behavior
Triggers
Enable dismissal of an alert via JavaScript:
'.alert'
alert
Or with
data
attributes on a button
within the alert
, as demonstrated above:
<button
type=
"button"
class=
"close"
data-dismiss=
"alert"
aria-label=
"Close"
<span
aria-hidden=
"true"
&times;
</span>
</button>
Note that closing an alert will remove it from the DOM.
