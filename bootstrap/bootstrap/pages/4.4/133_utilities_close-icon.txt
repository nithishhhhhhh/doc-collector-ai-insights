==================================================

Close icon
Use a generic close icon for dismissing content like modals and alerts.
Be sure to include text for screen readers
, as we’ve done with
aria-label
<button
type=
"button"
class=
"close"
aria-label=
"Close"
<span
aria-hidden=
"true"
&times;
</span>
</button>
