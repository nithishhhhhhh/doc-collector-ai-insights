==================================================

Spinners
Indicate the loading state of a component or page with Bootstrap spinners, built entirely with HTML, CSS, and no JavaScript.
About
For accessibility purposes, each loader here includes
role="status"
and a nested
<span class="sr-only">Loading...</span>
Border spinner
Use the border spinners for a lightweight loading indicator.
Loading...
<div
class=
"spinner-border"
role=
"status"
<span
class=
"sr-only"
Loading...
</span>
</div>
Colors
The border spinner uses
currentColor
for its
border-color
, meaning you can customize the color with
text color utilities
. You can use any of our text color utilities on the standard spinner.

Why not use
border-color
utilities?
Each border spinner specifies a
transparent
border for at least one side, so
.border-{color}
utilities would override that.
Growing spinner
If you don’t fancy a border spinner, switch to the grow spinner. While it doesn’t technically spin, it does repeatedly grow!
Loading...
<div
class=
"spinner-grow"
role=
"status"
<span
class=
"sr-only"
Loading...
</span>
</div>
Once again, this spinner is built with
currentColor
, so you can easily change its appearance with
text color utilities
. Here it is in blue, along with the supported variants.

Alignment
Spinners in Bootstrap are built with
currentColor
, and
display: inline-flex
. This means they can easily be resized, recolored, and quickly aligned.
Margin
margin utilities
like
.m-5
for easy spacing.
Loading...
<div
class=
"spinner-border m-5"
role=
"status"
<span
class=
"sr-only"
Loading...
</span>
</div>
Placement
flexbox utilities
float utilities
, or
text alignment
utilities to place spinners exactly where you need them in any situation.

role=
"status"
<span
class=
"sr-only"
Loading...
</span>
</div>

Use spinners within buttons to indicate an action is currently processing or taking place. You may also swap the text out of the spinner element and utilize button text as needed.
