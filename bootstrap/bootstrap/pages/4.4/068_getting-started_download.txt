Compiled CSS and JS
Download ready-to-use compiled code for
to easily drop into your project, which includes:
Compiled and minified CSS bundles (see
CSS files comparison
Compiled and minified JavaScript plugins
This doesn’t include documentation, source files, or any optional JavaScript dependencies (jQuery and Popper.js).
Download
Source files
Compile Bootstrap with your own asset pipeline by downloading our source Sass, JavaScript, and documentation files. This option requires some additional tooling:
Sass compiler (Libsass or Ruby Sass is supported) for compiling your CSS.
Autoprefixer
for CSS vendor prefixing
Should you require
build tools
, they are included for developing Bootstrap and its docs, but they’re likely unsuitable for your own purposes.

Package managers
Pull in Bootstrap’s
source files
into nearly any project with some of the most popular package managers. No matter the package manager, Bootstrap will
require a Sass compiler and
Autoprefixer
for a setup that matches our official compiled versions.
Install Bootstrap in your Node.js powered apps with
the npm package
install
require('bootstrap')
will load all of Bootstrap’s jQuery plugins onto the jQuery object. The
module itself does not export anything. You can manually load Bootstrap’s jQuery plugins individually by loading the
/js/*.js
files under the package’s top-level directory.
package.json
contains some additional metadata under the following keys:
sass
- path to Bootstrap’s main
Sass
source file
style
- path to Bootstrap’s non-minified CSS that’s been precompiled using the default settings (no customization)
yarn
Install Bootstrap in your Node.js powered apps with
the yarn package
yarn add bootstrap
RubyGems
Install Bootstrap in your Ruby apps using
Bundler
recommended
) and
RubyGems

for further details.
