Toasts
Push notifications to your visitors with a toast, a lightweight and easily customizable alert message.
Toasts are lightweight notifications designed to mimic the push notifications that have been popularized by mobile and desktop operating systems. They’re built with flexbox, so they’re easy to align and position.
Overview
Things to know when using the toast plugin:
If you’re building our JavaScript from source, it
requires
util.js
Toasts are opt-in for performance reasons, so
you must initialize them yourself
Please note that you are responsible for positioning toasts.
Toasts will automatically hide if you do not specify
autohide: false
The animation effect of this component is dependent on the
prefers-reduced-motion
media query. See the
reduced motion section of our accessibility documentation
Examples
Basic
To encourage extensible and predictable toasts, we recommend a header and body. Toast headers use
display: flex
, allowing easy alignment of content thanks to our margin and flexbox utilities.
Toasts are as flexible as you need and have very little required markup. At a minimum, we require a single element to contain your “toasted” content and strongly encourage a dismiss button.

Translucent
Toasts are slightly translucent, too, so they blend over whatever they might appear over. For browsers that support the
backdrop-filter
CSS property, we’ll also attempt to blur the elements under a toast.

Stacking
When you have multiple toasts, we default to vertically stacking them in a readable manner.

Placement
Place toasts with custom CSS as you need them. The top right is often used for notifications, as is the top middle. If you’re only ever going to show one toast at a time, put the positioning styles right on the
.toast

You can also get fancy with flexbox utilities to align toasts horizontally and/or vertically.

Accessibility
Toasts are intended to be small interruptions to your visitors or users, so to help those with screen readers and similar assistive technologies, you should wrap your toasts in an
aria-live
region
. Changes to live regions (such as injecting/updating a toast component) are automatically announced by screen readers without needing to move the user’s focus or otherwise interrupt the user. Additionally, include
aria-atomic="true"
to ensure that the entire toast is always announced as a single (atomic) unit, rather than announcing what was changed (which could lead to problems if you only update part of the toast’s content, or if displaying the same toast content at a later point in time). If the information needed is important for the process, e.g. for a list of errors in a form, then use the
alert component
instead of toast.
Note that the live region needs to be present in the markup
before
the toast is generated or updated. If you dynamically generate both at the same time and inject them into the page, they will generally not be announced by assistive technologies.
You also need to adapt the
role
aria-live
level depending on the content. If it’s an important message like an error, use
role="alert" aria-live="assertive"
, otherwise use
role="status" aria-live="polite"
attributes.
As the content you’re displaying changes, be sure to update the
delay
timeout
to ensure people have enough time to read the toast.
<div
class=
"toast"
role=
"alert"
aria-live=
"polite"
aria-atomic=
"true"
data-delay=
"10000"
<div
role=
"alert"
aria-live=
"assertive"
aria-atomic=
"true"
</div>
</div>
When using
autohide: false
, you must add a close button to allow users to dismiss the toast.

JavaScript behavior
Usage
Initialize toasts via JavaScript:
.toast
toast
option
Options
Options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to
data-
, as in
data-animation=""
Name
Type
Default
Description
animation
boolean
true
Apply a CSS fade transition to the toast
autohide
boolean
true

delay
number
Delay hiding the toast (ms)
Methods
Asynchronous methods and transitions
All API methods are
asynchronous
and start a
transition
. They return to the caller as soon as the transition is started but
before it ends
. In addition, a method call on a
transitioning component will be ignored
See our JavaScript documentation for more information
$().toast(options)
Attaches a toast handler to an element collection.
.toast('show')
Reveals an element’s toast.
Returns to the caller before the toast has actually been shown
(i.e. before the
shown.bs.toast
event occurs).
You have to manually call this method, instead your toast won’t show.
#element
toast
show
.toast('hide')
Hides an element’s toast.
Returns to the caller before the toast has actually been hidden
(i.e. before the
hidden.bs.toast
event occurs). You have to manually call this method if you made
autohide
false
#element
toast
hide
.toast('dispose')
Hides an element’s toast. Your toast will remain on the DOM but won’t show anymore.
#element
toast
dispose
