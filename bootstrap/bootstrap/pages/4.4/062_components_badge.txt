Badges
Documentation and examples for badges, our small count and labeling component.
Example
Badges scale to match the size of the immediate parent element by using relative font sizing and
units.

Badges can be used as part of links or buttons to provide a counter.
Notifications
<button
type=
"button"
class=
"btn btn-primary"
Notifications
<span
class=
"badge badge-light"
</span>
</button>
Note that depending on how they are used, badges may be confusing for users of screen readers and similar assistive technologies. While the styling of badges provides a visual cue as to their purpose, these users will simply be presented with the content of the badge. Depending on the specific situation, these badges may seem like random additional words or numbers at the end of a sentence, link, or button.
Unless the context is clear (as with the “Notifications” example, where it is understood that the “4” is the number of notifications), consider including additional context with a visually hidden piece of additional text.

Conveying meaning to assistive technologies
Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies – such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the
.sr-only
class.
Pill badges
Use the
.badge-pill
modifier class to make badges more rounded (with a larger
border-radius
and additional horizontal
padding
). Useful if you miss the badges from v3.
