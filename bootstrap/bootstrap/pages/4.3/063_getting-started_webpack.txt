==================================================

Webpack
Learn how to include Bootstrap in your project using Webpack.
Installing Bootstrap
Install bootstrap
as a Node.js module using npm.
Importing JavaScript
Import
by adding this line to your app’s entry point (usually
index.js
app.js
import
'bootstrap'
Alternatively, you may
import plugins individually
as needed:
import
'bootstrap/js/dist/util'
import
'bootstrap/js/dist/alert'
jQuery
Popper
these are defined as
peerDependencies
, this means that you will have to make sure to add both of them
to your
package.json
using
npm install --save jquery popper.js
Importing Styles
Importing Precompiled Sass
To enjoy the full potential of Bootstrap and customize it to your needs, use the source files as a part of your project’s bundling process.
First, create your own
_custom.scss
and use it to override the
built-in custom variables
. Then, use your main Sass file to import your custom variables, followed by Bootstrap:
@import
"custom"
@import
"~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap"
For Bootstrap to compile, make sure you install and use the required loaders:
sass-loader
postcss-loader
with
Autoprefixer
. With minimal setup, your webpack config should include this rule or similar:
test
scss
loader
'style-loader'
// inject CSS to page
loader
'css-loader'
// translates CSS into CommonJS modules
loader
'postcss-loader'
// Run postcss actions
options
plugins
function
// postcss plugins, can be exported to postcss.config.js
return
require
'autoprefixer'
loader
'sass-loader'
// compiles Sass to CSS
Importing Compiled CSS
Alternatively, you may use Bootstrap’s ready-to-use CSS by simply adding this line to your project’s entry point:
import
'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'
In this case you may use your existing rule for
without any special modifications to webpack config, except you don’t need
sass-loader
just
style-loader
css-loader
module
rules
test
css$/
'style-loader'
'css-loader'
