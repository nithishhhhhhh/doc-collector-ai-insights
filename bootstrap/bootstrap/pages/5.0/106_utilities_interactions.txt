.pe-none
class (and the
pointer-events
CSS property it sets) only prevents interactions with a pointer (mouse, stylus, touch). Links and controls with
.pe-none
are, by default, still focusable and actionable for keyboard users. To ensure that they are completely neutralized even for keyboard users, you may need to add further attributes such as
tabindex="-1"
(to prevent them from receiving keyboard focus) and
aria-disabled="true"
(to convey the fact they are effectively disabled to assistive technologies), and possibly use JavaScript to completely prevent them from being actionable. For form controls, consider using the
disabled
HTML attribute instead.
