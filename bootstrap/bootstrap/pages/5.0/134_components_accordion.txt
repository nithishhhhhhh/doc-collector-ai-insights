==================================================

How it works
The accordion uses
collapse
internally to make it collapsible. To render an accordion thatâ€™s expanded, add the
.open
class on the
.accordion
The animation effect of this component is dependent on the
prefers-reduced-motion
media query. See the
reduced motion section of our accessibility documentation
Example
Click the accordions below to expand/collapse the accordion content.
Accordion Item #1
This is the first item's accordion body.
It is shown by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the
.accordion-body
, though the transition does limit overflow.
Accordion Item #2
This is the second item's accordion body.
It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the
.accordion-body
, though the transition does limit overflow.
Accordion Item #3
This is the third item's accordion body.
It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables.

Flush
.accordion-flush
to remove the default
background-color
, some borders, and some rounded corners to render accordions edge-to-edge with their parent container.
Accordion Item #1
Placeholder content for this accordion, which is intended to demonstrate the
.accordion-flush
class. This is the first item's accordion body.
Accordion Item #2
Placeholder content for this accordion, which is intended to demonstrate the
.accordion-flush
class. This is the second item's accordion body. Let's imagine this being filled with some actual content.
Accordion Item #3
Placeholder content for this accordion, which is intended to demonstrate the
.accordion-flush
class. This is the third item's accordion body. Nothing more exciting happening here in terms of content, but just filling up the space to make it look, at least at first glance, a bit more representative of how this would look in a real-world application.
