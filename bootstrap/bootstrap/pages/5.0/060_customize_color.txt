Theme colors
We use a subset of all colors to create a smaller color palette for generating color schemes, also available as Sass variables and a Sass map in Bootstrap’s
scss/_variables.scss
file.
Primary
Secondary
Success
Danger
Warning
Info
Light
Dark
All these colors are available as a Sass map,
$theme-colors
$theme-colors
"primary"
$primary
"secondary"
$secondary
"success"
$success
"info"
$info
"warning"
$warning
"danger"
$danger
"light"
$light
"dark"
$dark
Check out
our Sass maps and loops docs
for how to modify these colors.
All colors
All Bootstrap colors are available as Sass variables and a Sass map in
scss/_variables.scss
file. To avoid increased file sizes, we don’t create text or background color classes for each of these variables. Instead, we choose a subset of these colors for a
theme palette
Be sure to monitor contrast ratios as you customize colors. As shown below, we’ve added three contrast ratios to each of the main colors—one for the swatch’s current colors, one for against white, and one for against black.

Notes on Sass
Sass cannot programmatically generate variables, so we manually created variables for every tint and shade ourselves. We specify the midpoint value (e.g.,
$blue-500
) and use custom color functions to tint (lighten) or shade (darken) our colors via Sass’s
mix()
color function.
Using
mix()
is not the same as
lighten()
darken()
—the former blends the specified color with white or black, while the latter only adjusts the lightness value of each color. The result is a much more complete suite of colors, as
shown in this CodePen demo
tint-color()
shade-color()
functions use
mix()
alongside our
$theme-color-interval
variable, which specifies a stepped percentage value for each mixed color we produce. See the
scss/_functions.scss
scss/_variables.scss
files for the full source code.
Color Sass maps
$colors
lists all our available base (
) colors
$theme-colors
lists all semantically named theme colors (shown below)
$grays
lists all tints and shades of gray
Within
scss/_variables.scss
, you’ll find Bootstrap’s color variables and Sass map. Here’s an example of the
$colors
Sass map:
$colors
"blue"
$blue
"indigo"
$indigo
"purple"
$purple
"pink"
$pink
"red"
$red
"orange"
$orange
"yellow"
$yellow
"green"
$green
"teal"
$teal
"cyan"
$cyan
"white"
$white
"gray"
$gray-600
"gray-dark"
$gray-800
Add, remove, or modify values within the map to update how they’re used in many other components. Unfortunately at this time, not
every
component utilizes this Sass map. Future updates will strive to improve upon this. Until then, plan on making use of the
${color}
variables and this Sass map.
Example
Here’s how you can use these in your Sass:
.alpha
color
$purple
.beta
color
$yellow-300
background-color
$indigo-900
Color
background
utility classes are also available for setting
color
background-color
using the
color values.
