==================================================

Approach
Reboot builds upon Normalize, providing many HTML elements with somewhat opinionated styles using only element selectors. Additional styling is done only with classes. For example, we reboot some
<table>
styles for a simpler baseline and later provide
.table
.table-bordered
, and more.
Here are our guidelines and reasons for choosing what to override in Reboot:
Update some browser default values to use
s instead of
s for scalable component spacing.
Avoid
margin-top
. Vertical margins can collapse, yielding unexpected results. More importantly though, a single direction of
margin
is a simpler mental model.
For easier scaling across device sizes, block elements should use
s for
margin
Keep declarations of
font
-related properties to a minimum, using
inherit
whenever possible.
Page defaults
<html>
<body>
elements are updated to provide better page-wide defaults. More specifically:
box-sizing
is globally set on every element—including
*::before
*::after
, to
border-box
. This ensures that the declared width of element is never exceeded due to padding or border.
No base
font-size
is declared on the
<html>
, but
16px
is assumed (the browser default).
font-size: 1rem
is applied on the
<body>
for easy responsive type-scaling via media queries while respecting user preferences and ensuring a more accessible approach. This browser default can be overridden by modifying the
$font-size-root
variable.
<body>
also sets a global
font-family
font-weight
line-height
, and
color
. This is inherited later by some form elements to prevent font inconsistencies.
For safety, the
<body>
has a declared
background-color
, defaulting to
#fff

Note that because the font stack includes emoji fonts, many common symbol/dingbat unicode characters will be rendered as multi-colored pictographs. Their appearance will vary, depending on the style used in the browser/platform’s native emoji font, and they won’t be affected by any CSS
color
styles.
This
font-family
is applied to the
<body>
and automatically inherited globally throughout Bootstrap. To switch the global
font-family
, update
$font-family-base
and recompile Bootstrap.
Headings and paragraphs
All heading elements—e.g.,
<h1>
—and
are reset to have their
margin-top
removed. Headings have
margin-bottom: .5rem
added and paragraphs
margin-bottom: 1rem
for easy spacing.
Heading
Example
<h1></h1>
h1. Bootstrap heading
<h2></h2>
h2. Bootstrap heading
<h3></h3>
h3. Bootstrap heading
<h4></h4>
h4. Bootstrap heading
<h5></h5>
h5. Bootstrap heading
<h6></h6>
h6. Bootstrap heading
Lists
All lists—
<ul>
<ol>
, and
<dl>
—have their
margin-top
removed and a
margin-bottom: 1rem
. Nested lists have no
margin-bottom
. We’ve also reset the
padding-left
<ul>
<ol>
elements.
All lists have their top margin removed
And their bottom margin normalized
Nested lists have no bottom margin
This way they have a more even appearance
Particularly when followed by more list items
The left padding has also been reset
Here’s an ordered list

For simpler styling, clear hierarchy, and better spacing, description lists have updated

Description lists
A description list is perfect for defining terms.

Inline code
Wrap inline snippets of code with
<code>
. Be sure to escape HTML angle brackets.
For example,
<section>
should be wrapped as inline.
For example,
code
&lt;
section
&gt;
code
should be wrapped as inline.
Code blocks
<pre>
s for multiple lines of code. Once again, be sure to escape any angle brackets in the code for proper rendering. The
<pre>
element is reset to remove its
margin-top
and use
units for its
margin-bottom

<p>And another line of sample text here...</p>

Forms
Various form elements have been rebooted for simpler base styles. Here are some of the most notable changes:
<fieldset>
s have no borders, padding, or margin so they can be easily used as wrappers for individual inputs or groups of inputs.
<legend>
s, like fieldsets, have also been restyled to be displayed as a heading of sorts.
<label>
s are set to
display: inline-block
to allow
margin
to be applied.
<input>
<select>
<textarea>
s, and
<button>
s are mostly addressed by Normalize, but Reboot removes their
margin
and sets
line-height: inherit
, too.
<textarea>
s are modified to only be resizable vertically as horizontal resizing often “breaks” page layout.
<button>
s and
<input>
button elements have
cursor: pointer
when
:not(:disabled)
These changes, and more, are demonstrated below.
Example legend

Example email
Example telephone
Example url

Keep in mind date inputs are
not fully supported
by all browsers, namely Safari.
Pointers on buttons
Reboot includes an enhancement for
role="button"
to change the default cursor to
pointer
. Add this attribute to elements to help indicate elements are interactive. This role isn’t necessary for
<button>
elements, which get their own
cursor
change.

Blockquote
The default
margin
on blockquotes is
1em 40px
, so we reset that to
0 0 1rem
for something more consistent with other elements.

Summary
The default
cursor
on summary is
text
, so we reset that to
pointer
to convey that the element can be interacted with by clicking on it.

Here are even more details about the details.
HTML5
[hidden]
attribute
HTML5 adds
a new global attribute named
[hidden]
, which is styled as
display: none
by default. Borrowing an idea from
PureCSS
, we improve upon this default by making
[hidden] { display: none !important; }
to help prevent its
display
from getting accidentally overridden.
input
type
"text"
hidden
jQuery incompatibility
[hidden]
is not compatible with jQuery’s
$(...).hide()
$(...).show()
methods. Therefore, we don’t currently especially endorse
[hidden]
over other techniques for managing the
display
of elements.
To merely toggle the visibility of an element, meaning its
display
is not modified and the element can still affect the flow of the document, use
.invisible
class
instead.
