==================================================

About
card
is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. If you’re familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar functionality to those components is available as modifier classes for cards.
Example
Cards are built with as little markup and styles as possible, but still manage to deliver a ton of control and customization. Built with flexbox, they offer easy alignment and mix well with other Bootstrap components. They have no
margin
by default, so use
spacing utilities
as needed.
Below is an example of a basic card with mixed content and a fixed width. Cards have no fixed width to start, so they’ll naturally fill the full width of its parent element. This is easily customized with our various
sizing options

Content types
Cards support a wide variety of content, including images, text, list groups, links, and more. Below are examples of what’s supported.
Body
The building block of a card is the
.card-body
. Use it whenever you need a padded section within a card.
This is some text within a card body.
class
"card"
class
"card-body"
This is some text within a card body.
Titles, text, and links
Card titles are used by adding
.card-title
to a
<h*>
tag. In the same way, links are added and placed next to each other by adding
.card-link
to an
tag.
Subtitles are used by adding a
.card-subtitle
to a
<h*>
tag. If the
.card-title
and the
.card-subtitle
items are placed in a
.card-body
item, the card title and subtitle are aligned nicely.

Images

can also be styled with the standard HTML tags.

Sizing
Cards assume no specific
width
to start, so they’ll be 100% wide unless otherwise stated. You can change this as needed with custom CSS, grid classes, grid Sass mixins, or utilities.
Using grid markup
Using the grid, wrap cards in columns and rows as needed.

Images
Cards include a few options for working with images. Choose from appending “image caps” at either end of a card, overlaying images with card content, or simply embedding the image in a card.
Image caps
Similar to headers and footers, cards can include top and bottom “image caps”—images at the top or bottom of a card.

Note that content should not be larger than the height of the image. If content is larger than the image the content will be displayed outside the image.
Horizontal
Using a combination of grid and utility classes, cards can be made horizontal in a mobile-friendly and responsive way. In the example below, we remove the grid gutters with
.g-0
and use
.col-md-*
classes to make the card horizontal at the
breakpoint. Further adjustments may be needed depending on your card content.

Conveying meaning to assistive technologies
Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies – such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the
.visually-hidden
class.

Card layout
In addition to styling the content within cards, Bootstrap includes a few options for laying out series of cards. For the time being,
these layout options are not yet responsive
Card groups
Use card groups to render cards as a single, attached element with equal width and height columns. Card groups start off stacked and use
display: flex;
to become attached with uniform dimensions starting at the
breakpoint.

Grid cards
Use the Bootstrap grid system and its
.row-cols
classes
to control how many grid columns (wrapped around your cards) you show per row. For example, here’s
.row-cols-1
laying out the cards on one column, and
.row-cols-md-2
splitting four cards to equal width across multiple rows, from the medium breakpoint up.

When you need equal height, add

to the cards. If you want equal heights by default, you can set
$card-height: 100%
in Sass.

Masonry
we used a CSS-only technique to mimic the behavior of
Masonry
-like columns, but this technique came with lots of unpleasant
side effects
. If you want to have this type of layout in
, you can just make use of Masonry plugin.
Masonry is not included in Bootstrap
, but we’ve made a
demo example
to help you get started.
