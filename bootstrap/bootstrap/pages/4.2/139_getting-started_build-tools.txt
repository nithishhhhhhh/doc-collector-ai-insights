==================================================

Build tools
Learn how to use Bootstrap’s included npm scripts to build our documentation, compile source code, run tests, and more.
Tooling setup
NPM scripts
for its build system. Our
package.json
includes convenient methods for working with the framework, including compiling code, running tests, and more.
To use our build system and run our documentation locally, you’ll need a copy of Bootstrap’s source files and Node. Follow these steps and you should be ready to rock:
Download and install Node.js
, which we use to manage our dependencies.
Navigate to the root
/bootstrap
directory and run
npm install
to install our local dependencies listed in
package.json
Install Ruby
, install
Bundler
with
gem install bundler
, and finally run
bundle install
. This will install all Ruby dependencies, such as Jekyll and plugins.
Windows users:
Read
this guide
to get Jekyll up and running without problems.
When completed, you’ll be able to run the various commands provided from the command line.
Using NPM scripts
package.json
includes the following commands and tasks:
Task
Description
npm run dist
npm run dist
creates the
/dist
directory with compiled files.
Uses
Sass
Autoprefixer
, and
UglifyJS
npm test
Same as
npm run dist
plus it runs tests locally
npm run docs
Builds and lints CSS and JavaScript for docs. You can then run the documentation locally via
npm run docs-serve
npm run
to see all the npm scripts.
Autoprefixer
Autoprefixer
(included in our build process) to automatically add vendor prefixes to some CSS properties at build time. Doing so saves us time and code by allowing us to write key parts of our CSS a single time while eliminating the need for vendor mixins like those found in v3.
We maintain the list of browsers supported through Autoprefixer in a separate file within our GitHub repository. See
/.browserslistrc
for details.
Local documentation
Running our documentation locally requires the use of Jekyll, a decently flexible static site generator that provides us: basic includes, Markdown-based files, templates, and more. Here’s how to get it started:
Run through the
tooling setup
above to install Jekyll (the site builder) and other Ruby dependencies with
bundle install
From the root
/bootstrap
directory, run
npm run docs-serve
in the command line.
Open
http://localhost:9001
in your browser, and voilà.

documentation
Troubleshooting
Should you encounter problems with installing dependencies, uninstall all previous dependency versions (global and local). Then, rerun
npm install
