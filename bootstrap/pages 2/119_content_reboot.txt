==================================================

Approach
Reboot builds upon Normalize, providing many HTML elements with somewhat opinionated styles using only element selectors. Additional styling is done only with classes. For example, we reboot some
<table>
styles for a simpler baseline and later provide
.table
.table-bordered
, and more.
Here are our guidelines and reasons for choosing what to override in Reboot:
Update some browser default values to use
s instead of
s for scalable component spacing.
Avoid
margin-top
. Vertical margins can collapse, yielding unexpected results. More importantly though, a single direction of
margin
is a simpler mental model.
For easier scaling across device sizes, block elements should use
s for
margin
Keep declarations of
font
-related properties to a minimum, using
inherit
whenever possible.
CSS variables
Added in v5.2.0
With v5.1.1, we standardized our required
@import
s across all our CSS bundles (including
, and
) to include
_root.scss
. This adds
:root
level CSS variables to all bundles, regardless of how many of them are used in that bundle. Ultimately Bootstrap 5 will continue to see more
CSS variables
added over time, in order to provide more real-time customization without the need to always recompile Sass. Our approach is to take our source Sass variables and transform them into CSS variables. That way, even if you don’t use CSS variables, you still have all the power of Sass.
This is still in-progress and will take time to fully implement.
For example, consider these
:root
CSS variables for common
<body>
styles:
scss/_root.scss
$font-size-root
!= null
#{$prefix}
root-font-size
#{$font-size-root}
#{$prefix}
body-font-family
inspect
$font-family-base
@include
$font-size-base
#{$prefix}
body-font-size
#{$prefix}
body-font-weight
#{$font-weight-base}
#{$prefix}
body-line-height
#{$line-height-base}
$body-text-align
!= null
#{$prefix}
body-text-align
#{$body-text-align}
#{$prefix}
body-color
#{$body-color}
#{$prefix}
body-color-rgb
to-rgb
$body-color
#{$prefix}
body-bg
#{$body-bg}
#{$prefix}
body-bg-rgb
to-rgb
$body-bg
#{$prefix}
emphasis-color
#{$body-emphasis-color}
#{$prefix}
emphasis-color-rgb
to-rgb
$body-emphasis-color
#{$prefix}
secondary-color
#{$body-secondary-color}
#{$prefix}
secondary-color-rgb
to-rgb
$body-secondary-color
#{$prefix}
secondary-bg
#{$body-secondary-bg}
#{$prefix}
secondary-bg-rgb
to-rgb
$body-secondary-bg
#{$prefix}
tertiary-color
#{$body-tertiary-color}
#{$prefix}
tertiary-color-rgb
to-rgb
$body-tertiary-color
#{$prefix}
tertiary-bg
#{$body-tertiary-bg}
#{$prefix}
tertiary-bg-rgb
to-rgb
$body-tertiary-bg
In practice, those variables are then applied in Reboot like so:
scss/_reboot.scss
body
margin
// 1
font-family
#{$prefix}
body-font-family
@include
font-size
#{$prefix}
body-font-size
font-weight
#{$prefix}
body-font-weight
line-height
#{$prefix}
body-line-height
color
#{$prefix}
body-color
text-align
#{$prefix}
body-text-align
background-color
#{$prefix}
body-bg
// 2
-webkit-text-size-adjust
100%
// 3
-webkit-tap-highlight-color
rgba
$black
// 4
Which allows you to make real-time customizations however you like:
body
style
--bs-body-color
#333
<!-- ... -->
body
Page defaults
<html>
<body>
elements are updated to provide better page-wide defaults. More specifically:
box-sizing
is globally set on every element—including
*::before
*::after
, to
border-box
. This ensures that the declared width of element is never exceeded due to padding or border.
No base
font-size
is declared on the
<html>
, but
16px
is assumed (the browser default).
font-size: 1rem
is applied on the
<body>
for easy responsive type-scaling via media queries while respecting user preferences and ensuring a more accessible approach. This browser default can be overridden by modifying the
$font-size-root
variable.
<body>
also sets a global
font-family
font-weight
line-height
, and
color
. This is inherited later by some form elements to prevent font inconsistencies.
For safety, the
<body>
has a declared
background-color
, defaulting to
#fff

Note that because the font stack includes emoji fonts, many common symbol/dingbat Unicode characters will be rendered as multicolored pictographs. Their appearance will vary, depending on the style used in the browser/platform’s native emoji font, and they won’t be affected by any CSS
color
styles.
This
font-family
is applied to the
<body>
and automatically inherited globally throughout Bootstrap. To switch the global
font-family
, update
$font-family-base
and recompile Bootstrap.
Headings
All heading elements—
<h1>
<h6>
have their
margin-top
removed,
margin-bottom: .5rem
set, and
line-height
tightened. While headings inherit their
color
by default, you can also override it via optional CSS variable,
--bs-heading-color
Heading
Example
<h1></h1>
h1. Bootstrap heading
<h2></h2>
h2. Bootstrap heading
<h3></h3>
h3. Bootstrap heading
<h4></h4>
h4. Bootstrap heading
<h5></h5>
h5. Bootstrap heading
<h6></h6>
h6. Bootstrap heading
Paragraphs
elements have their
margin-top
removed and
margin-bottom: 1rem
set for easy spacing.
This is an example paragraph.
html
This is an example paragraph.
Links
Links have a default
color
and underline applied. While links change on
:hover
, they don’t change based on whether someone
:visited
the link. They also receive no special
:focus
styles.
This is an example link
html
href
This is an example link
As of v5.3.x, link
color
is set using
rgba()
and new
-rgb
CSS variables, allowing for easy customization of link color opacity. Change the link color opacity with the
--bs-link-opacity
CSS variable:
This is an example link
html
href
style
--bs-link-opacity
This is an example link
Placeholder links—those without an
href
—are targeted with a more specific selector and have their
color
text-decoration
reset to their default values.
This is a placeholder link
html

Horizontal rules
<hr>
element has been simplified. Similar to browser defaults,
<hr>
s are styled via
border-top
, have a default
opacity: .25
, and automatically inherit their
border-color
color
, including when
color
is set via the parent. They can be modified with text, border, and opacity utilities.

Lists
All lists—
<ul>
<ol>
, and
<dl>
—have their
margin-top
removed and a
margin-bottom: 1rem
. Nested lists have no
margin-bottom
. We’ve also reset the
padding-left
<ul>
<ol>
elements.
All lists have their top margin removed
And their bottom margin normalized
Nested lists have no bottom margin
This way they have a more even appearance
Particularly when followed by more list items
The left padding has also been reset
Here’s an ordered list
With a few list items
It has the same overall look

For simpler styling, clear hierarchy, and better spacing, description lists have updated
margin
<dd>
s reset

Description lists
A description list is perfect for defining terms.

Inline code
Wrap inline snippets of code with
<code>
. Be sure to escape HTML angle brackets.
For example,
<section>
should be wrapped as inline.
html
For example,
code
&lt;
section
&gt;
code
should be wrapped as inline.
Code blocks
<pre>
s for multiple lines of code. Once again, be sure to escape any angle brackets in the code for proper rendering. The
<pre>
element is reset to remove its
margin-top
and use
units for its
margin-bottom
<p>Sample text here...</p>
<p>And another line of sample text here...</p>

Forms
Various form elements have been rebooted for simpler base styles. Here are some of the most notable changes:
<fieldset>
s have no borders, padding, or margin so they can be easily used as wrappers for individual inputs or groups of inputs.
<legend>
s, like fieldsets, have also been restyled to be displayed as a heading of sorts.
<label>
s are set to
display: inline-block
to allow
margin
to be applied.
<input>
<select>
<textarea>
s, and
<button>
s are mostly addressed by Normalize, but Reboot removes their
margin
and sets
line-height: inherit
, too.
<textarea>
s are modified to only be resizable vertically as horizontal resizing often “breaks” page layout.
<button>
s and
<input>
button elements have
cursor: pointer
when
:not(:disabled)
These changes, and more, are demonstrated below.
Some date inputs types are
not fully supported
by the latest versions of Safari and Firefox.

Pointers on buttons
Reboot includes an enhancement for
role="button"
to change the default cursor to
pointer
. Add this attribute to elements to help indicate elements are interactive. This role isn’t necessary for
<button>
elements, which get their own
cursor
change.

HTML5
[hidden]
attribute
HTML5 adds
a new global attribute named
[hidden]
, which is styled as
display: none
by default. Borrowing an idea from
PureCSS
, we improve upon this default by making
[hidden] { display: none !important; }
to help prevent its
display
from getting accidentally overridden.
input
type
text
hidden
Since
[hidden]
is not compatible with jQuery’s
$(...).hide()
$(...).show()
methods, we don’t specifically endorse
[hidden]
over other techniques for managing the
display
of elements.
To merely toggle the visibility of an element, meaning its
display
is not modified and the element can still affect the flow of the document, use
.invisible
class
instead.
