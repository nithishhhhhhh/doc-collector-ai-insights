Text alignment
Easily realign text to components with text alignment classes. For start, end, and center alignment, responsive classes are available that use the same viewport width breakpoints as the grid system.
Start aligned text on all viewport sizes.
Center aligned text on all viewport sizes.
End aligned text on all viewport sizes.
End aligned text on viewports sized SM (small) or wider.
End aligned text on viewports sized MD (medium) or wider.
End aligned text on viewports sized LG (large) or wider.
End aligned text on viewports sized XL (extra large) or wider.
End aligned text on viewports sized XXL (extra extra large) or wider.
html
class
text-start
Start aligned text on all viewport sizes.
class
text-center
Center aligned text on all viewport sizes.
class
text-end
End aligned text on all viewport sizes.
class
text-sm-end
End aligned text on viewports sized SM (small) or wider.
class
text-md-end
End aligned text on viewports sized MD (medium) or wider.
class
text-lg-end
End aligned text on viewports sized LG (large) or wider.
class
text-xl-end
End aligned text on viewports sized XL (extra large) or wider.
class
text-xxl-end
End aligned text on viewports sized XXL (extra extra large) or wider.
Note that we don’t provide utility classes for justified text. While, aesthetically, justified text might look more appealing, it does make word-spacing more random and therefore harder to read.
Text wrapping and overflow
Wrap text with a
.text-wrap
class.
This text should wrap.
html
class
badge text-bg-primary text-wrap
style
width
6rem
This text should wrap.
Prevent text from wrapping with a
.text-nowrap
class.
This text should overflow the parent.
html
class
text-nowrap bg-body-secondary border
style
width
8rem
This text should overflow the parent.
Word break
Prevent long strings of text from breaking your components’ layout by using
.text-break
to set
word-wrap: break-word
word-break: break-word
. We use
word-wrap
instead of the more common
overflow-wrap
for wider browser support, and add the deprecated
word-break: break-word
to avoid issues with flex containers.
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
html
class
text-break
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Note that
breaking words isn’t possible in Arabic
, which is the most used RTL language. Therefore
.text-break
is removed from our RTL compiled CSS.
Text transform
Transform text in components with our text capitalization classes:
text-lowercase
text-uppercase
text-capitalize
Lowercased text.
Uppercased text.
CapiTaliZed text.
html
class
text-lowercase
Lowercased text.
class
text-uppercase
Uppercased text.
class
text-capitalize
CapiTaliZed text.
Note how
.text-capitalize
only changes the first letter of each word, leaving the case of any other letters unaffected.
Font size
Quickly change the
font-size
of text. While our heading classes (e.g.,
) apply
font-size
font-weight
, and
line-height
, these utilities
only
apply
font-size
. Sizing for these utilities matches HTML’s heading elements, so as the number increases, their size decreases.
