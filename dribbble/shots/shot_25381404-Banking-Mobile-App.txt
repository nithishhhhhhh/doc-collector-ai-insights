ðŸ’Œ Have a mobile app idea? We are available for new projects!
Hi everyone! Our team recently developed a design concept for a mobile banking application, and we're eager to share its features.
There is a main screen, a transfer screen, and a user profile. The app also displays a transaction history screen, a settings screen, and a partner list with map search functionality.
The design employs a light theme with an accent green shade, providing a fresh and modern appearance.
The standout characteristic of this design is its minimalistic functionality, offering only essential information so users can quickly find what they need and manage personal finances efficiently.
