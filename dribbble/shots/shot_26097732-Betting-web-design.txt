A bold and immersive UI concept for a sports betting platform with a strong focus on live action and community features.
This layout blends entertainment and analytics, offering users real-time game stats, curated short clips, and a streamlined betting flowâ€”all in one place. Dark theme with vibrant accents enhances focus, while playful 3D dice elements add character without compromising clarity.
Built for fans who want to stay informed, engaged, and one tap away from placing the perfect bet.
