Introducing the UX UI design for the marketplace of vetted developers. Our task was to make a UI UX design for a service that helps users find the perfect developer for their team. Wildcodes are on a mission to unite the best worldwide experts and leading tech companies with ease for the benefit of both. We clearly defined the project objectives including functionality, content requirements and branding. As the client provided a previously developed corporate identity in a pixel module, we clearly followed it when designing the site.
