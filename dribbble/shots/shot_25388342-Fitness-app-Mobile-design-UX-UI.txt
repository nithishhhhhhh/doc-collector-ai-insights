Our work process
included everything from competitor analysis and creating a mood board for the design style, to delivering fully prepared screens ready for development. We focused on understanding the market, defining visual direction, and refining each screen for a seamless development handoff.
We’re thrilled to showcase a mobile app we designed to simplify calorie tracking for gym members. This app brings together
Gym News
,
Training Plans
, and
Nutrition Tools
for a seamless fitness experience.
From Sketches to Success: Our Work on the Smarter Calorie Tracking App
We’re proud to present a project our studio developed from the ground up. Starting with initial sketches, examples, and references, we crafted every detail of this app to ensure a smooth and engaging user experience.
🚀Currently, due to the app's attractive interface, the number of
active users
has increased by
35%
