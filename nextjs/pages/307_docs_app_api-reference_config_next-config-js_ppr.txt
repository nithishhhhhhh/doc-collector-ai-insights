Incremental Adoption (Version 15)
In Next.js 15, you can incrementally adopt Partial Prerendering in
layouts
pages
by setting the
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
next.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
option in
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
incremental
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
experimental_ppr
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, and exporting the
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
experimental: {
ppr: 'incremental',
export default nextConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
route config option
at the top of the file:
next.config.ts
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
experimental: {
ppr: 'incremental',
export default nextConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
app/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
--- CODE BLOCK 8 ---
import { Suspense } from "react"
import { StaticComponent, DynamicComponent, Fallback } from "@/app/ui"
export const experimental_ppr = true
export default function Page() {
return {
<StaticComponent />
<Suspense fallback={<Fallback />}>
<DynamicComponent />
</Suspense>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Good to know
Routes that don't have
--- CODE BLOCK 11 ---
experimental_ppr
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
will default to
--- CODE BLOCK 12 ---
experimental_ppr
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
and will not be prerendered using PPR. You need to explicitly opt-in to PPR for each route.
--- CODE BLOCK 15 ---
incremental
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
will apply to all children of the route segment, including nested layouts and pages. You don't have to add it to every file, only the top segment of a route.
To disable PPR for children segments, you can set
[CODE_BLOCK_12]
[CODE_BLOCK_13]
in the child segment.
