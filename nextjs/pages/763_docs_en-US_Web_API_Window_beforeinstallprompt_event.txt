--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
beforeinstallprompt
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
event fires when the browser has detected that a website can be
installed as a Progressive Web App
There's no guaranteed time this event is fired, but it usually happens on page load.
The typical use for this event is when a web app wants to provide its own in-app UI inviting the user to install the app, rather than the generic one provided by the browser. This enables the app to provide more context about the app, explaining to the user why they might want to install it.
In this scenario, the handler for this event will:
Keep a reference to the
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
BeforeInstallPromptEvent
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
object that's passed into it
Reveal its in-app installation UI (this should be hidden by default, because not all browsers will support installation).
When the user uses the in-app installation UI to install the app, the in-app installation UI calls the
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
BeforeInstallPromptEvent
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
method of the retained
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
addEventListener()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
object to show the installation prompt.
Syntax
Use the event name in methods like
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
addEventListener("beforeinstallprompt", (event) => { })
onbeforeinstallprompt = (event) => { }
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, or set an event handler property.

Non-standard
Experimental
Returns an array of string items containing the platforms on which the event was dispatched. This is provided for user agents that want to present a choice of versions to the user such as, for example, "web" or "play" which would allow the user to choose between a web version or an Android version.

Non-standard
Experimental
Returns a

Event methods
--- CODE BLOCK 21 ---
BeforeInstallPromptEvent
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Non-standard
Experimental
Show a prompt asking the user if they want to install the app. This method returns a
--- CODE BLOCK 22 ---
let installPrompt = null;
const installButton = document.querySelector("#install");
window.addEventListener("beforeinstallprompt", (event) => {
event.preventDefault();
installPrompt = event;
installButton.removeAttribute("hidden");
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
that resolves to an object describing the user's choice when they were prompted to install the app.
Examples
In the following example an app provides its own install button, which has an
--- CODE BLOCK 23 ---
let installPrompt = null;
const installButton = document.querySelector("#install");
window.addEventListener("beforeinstallprompt", (event) => {
event.preventDefault();
installPrompt = event;
installButton.removeAttribute("hidden");
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 25 ---
installPrompt
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
. Initially the button is hidden.
