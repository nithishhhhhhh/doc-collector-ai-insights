The experimental

--- END CODE BLOCK ---
option allows you to cache
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
cache: 'no-store'
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
responses in Server Components across Hot Module Replacement (HMR) refreshes in local development. This results in faster responses and reduced costs for billed API calls.
By default, the HMR cache applies to all
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
serverComponentsHmrCache
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
requests, including those with the
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
next.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
option. This means uncached requests will not show fresh data between HMR refreshes. However, the cache will be cleared on navigation or full-page reloads.
You can disable the HMR cache by setting

Good to know:
For better observability, we recommend using the
[CODE_BLOCK_10]
option which logs fetch cache hits and misses in the console during development.
