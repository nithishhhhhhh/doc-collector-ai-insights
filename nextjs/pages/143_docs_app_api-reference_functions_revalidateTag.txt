Functions
revalidateTag
revalidateTag
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
revalidateTag
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
allows you to purge
cached data
on-demand for a specific cache tag.
Good to know
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
revalidateTag
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
only invalidates the cache when the path is next visited. This means calling
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
revalidateTag
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
with a dynamic route segment will not immediately trigger many revalidations at once. The invalidation only happens when the path is next visited.
Parameters
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
revalidateTag(tag: string): void;
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 8 ---
fetch(url, { next: { tags: [...] } });
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
: A string representing the cache tag associated with the data you want to revalidate. Must be less than or equal to 256 characters. This value is case-sensitive.
You can add tags to
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
fetch(url, { next: { tags: [...] } });
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
as follows:
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
revalidateTag
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Returns
--- CODE BLOCK 12 ---
'use server'
import { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache'
export default async function submit() {
await addPost()
revalidateTag('posts')
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
does not return a value.
