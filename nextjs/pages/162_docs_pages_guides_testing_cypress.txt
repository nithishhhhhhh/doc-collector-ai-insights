How to set up Cypress with Next.js
Cypress
is a test runner used for
End-to-End (E2E)
Component Testing
. This page will show you how to set up Cypress with Next.js and write your first tests.
Warning:
Cypress versions below 13.6.3 do not support
TypeScript version 5
with
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
moduleResolution:"bundler"
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
. However, this issue has been resolved in Cypress version 13.6.3 and later.
cypress v13.6.3
Manual setup
To manually set up Cypress, install
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
npm install -D cypress
# or
yarn add -D cypress
# or
pnpm install -D cypress
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
as a dev dependency:
Terminal
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
npm install -D cypress
# or
yarn add -D cypress
# or
pnpm install -D cypress
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Add the Cypress
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
"scripts": {
"dev": "next dev",
"build": "next build",
"start": "next start",
"lint": "next lint",
"cypress:open": "cypress open"
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
command to the
--- CODE BLOCK 8 ---
"scripts": {
"dev": "next dev",
"build": "next build",
"start": "next start",
"lint": "next lint",
"cypress:open": "cypress open"
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
scripts field:
package.json
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
npm run cypress:open
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Run Cypress for the first time to open the Cypress testing suite:
Terminal
--- CODE BLOCK 11 ---
cypress.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
You can choose to configure
E2E Testing
and/or
Component Testing
. Selecting any of these options will automatically create a
--- CODE BLOCK 14 ---
import { defineConfig } from 'cypress'
export default defineConfig({
e2e: {
setupNodeEvents(on, config) {},
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
file and a
--- CODE BLOCK 15 ---
import { defineConfig } from 'cypress'
export default defineConfig({
e2e: {
setupNodeEvents(on, config) {},
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
folder in your project.
Creating your first Cypress E2E test
Ensure your
--- CODE BLOCK 16 ---
import Link from 'next/link'
export default function Home() {
return (
<div>
<h1>Home</h1>
<Link href="/about">About</Link>
</div>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
file has the following configuration:
cypress.config.ts
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
--- CODE BLOCK 17 ---
import Link from 'next/link'
export default function Home() {
return (
<div>
<h1>Home</h1>
<Link href="/about">About</Link>
</div>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Then, create two new Next.js files:
pages/index.js
--- CODE BLOCK 19 ---
import Link from 'next/link'
export default function About() {
return (
<div>
<h1>About</h1>
<Link href="/">Home</Link>
</div>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
pages/about.js
--- CODE BLOCK 21 ---
describe('Navigation', () => {
it('should navigate to the about page', () => {
// Start from the index page
cy.visit('http://localhost:3000/')
// Find a link with an href attribute containing "about" and click it
cy.get('a[href*="about"]').click()
// The new url should include "/about"
cy.url().should('include', '/about')
// The new page should contain an h1 with "About"
cy.get('h1').contains('About')
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Add a test to check your navigation is working correctly:
cypress/e2e/app.cy.js
--- CODE BLOCK 23 ---
npm run cypress:open
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Running E2E Tests
Cypress will simulate a user navigating your application, this requires your Next.js server to be running. We recommend running your tests against your production code to more closely resemble how your application will behave.
--- CODE BLOCK 25 ---
cy.visit("http://localhost:3000/")
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
to build your Next.js application, then run
--- CODE BLOCK 26 ---
baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000'
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
in another terminal window to start Cypress and run your E2E Testing suite.
Good to know:
You can use
--- CODE BLOCK 27 ---
cypress.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
instead of
--- CODE BLOCK 28 ---
start-server-and-test
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
by adding
--- CODE BLOCK 29 ---
"test": "start-server-and-test start http://localhost:3000 cypress"
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
to the
--- CODE BLOCK 30 ---
package.json
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
configuration file.
Alternatively, you can install the
--- CODE BLOCK 31 ---
cypress/component
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
package to run the Next.js production server in conjunction with Cypress. After installation, add
--- CODE BLOCK 32 ---
cypress.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
to your
--- CODE BLOCK 33 ---
cypress.config
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
scripts field. Remember to rebuild your application after new changes.
Creating your first Cypress component test
Component tests build and mount a specific component without having to bundle your whole application or start a server.
Select
Component Testing
in the Cypress app, then select
Next.js
as your front-end framework. A
--- CODE BLOCK 34 ---
import { defineConfig } from 'cypress'
export default defineConfig({
component: {
devServer: {
framework: 'next',
bundler: 'webpack',
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
folder will be created in your project, and a
--- CODE BLOCK 35 ---
import { defineConfig } from 'cypress'
export default defineConfig({
component: {
devServer: {
framework: 'next',
bundler: 'webpack',
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
file will be updated to enable Component Testing.
Ensure your
--- CODE BLOCK 36 ---
import AboutPage from '../../pages/about'
describe('<AboutPage />', () => {
it('should render and display expected content', () => {
// Mount the React component for the About page
cy.mount(<AboutPage />)
// The new page should contain an h1 with "About page"
cy.get('h1').contains('About')
// Validate that a link with the expected URL is present
// *Following* the link is better suited to an E2E test
cy.get('a[href="/"]').should('be.visible')
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
file has the following configuration:
cypress.config.ts
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
--- CODE BLOCK 37 ---
import AboutPage from '../../pages/about'
describe('<AboutPage />', () => {
it('should render and display expected content', () => {
// Mount the React component for the About page
cy.mount(<AboutPage />)
// The new page should contain an h1 with "About page"
cy.get('h1').contains('About')
// Validate that a link with the expected URL is present
// *Following* the link is better suited to an E2E test
cy.get('a[href="/"]').should('be.visible')
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Assuming the same components from the previous section, add a test to validate a component is rendering the expected output:
cypress/component/about.cy.js
--- CODE BLOCK 41 ---
cypress run
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Good to know
Cypress currently doesn't support Component Testing for
--- CODE BLOCK 43 ---
"scripts": {
//...
"e2e": "start-server-and-test dev http://localhost:3000 \"cypress open --e2e\"",
"e2e:headless": "start-server-and-test dev http://localhost:3000 \"cypress run --e2e\"",
"component": "cypress open --component",
"component:headless": "cypress run --component"
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Server Components. We recommend using E2E testing.
Since component tests do not require a Next.js server, features like
[CODE_BLOCK_39]
that rely on a server being available may not function out-of-the-box.
Running Component Tests
[CODE_BLOCK_40]
in your terminal to start Cypress and run your Component Testing suite.
Continuous Integration (CI)
In addition to interactive testing, you can also run Cypress headlessly using the
[CODE_BLOCK_41]
command, which is better suited for CI environments:
package.json
[CODE_BLOCK_42]
