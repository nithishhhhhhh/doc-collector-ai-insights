Server-side Rendering (SSR)
You are currently viewing the documentation for Pages Router.
Server-side Rendering (SSR)
Also referred to as "SSR" or "Dynamic Rendering".
If a page uses
Server-side Rendering
, the page HTML is generated on
each request
To use Server-side Rendering for a page, you need to
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
getServerSideProps
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
getServerSideProps
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
function called
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
export default function Page({ data }) {
// Render data...
// This gets called on every request
export async function getServerSideProps() {
// Fetch data from external API
const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`)
const data = await res.json()
// Pass data to the page via props
return { props: { data } }
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
. This function will be called by the server on every request.
For example, suppose that your page needs to pre-render frequently updated data (fetched from an external API). You can write
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
export default function Page({ data }) {
// Render data...
// This gets called on every request
export async function getServerSideProps() {
// Fetch data from external API
const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`)
const data = await res.json()
// Pass data to the page via props
return { props: { data } }
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
which fetches this data and passes it to
--- CODE BLOCK 8 ---
getServerSideProps
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
like below:
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
getStaticProps
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
As you can see,
--- CODE BLOCK 11 ---
getServerSideProps
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
is similar to
[CODE_BLOCK_9]
, but the difference is that
[CODE_BLOCK_10]
is run on every request instead of on build time.
To learn more about how
[CODE_BLOCK_11]
works, check out our
Data Fetching documentation
