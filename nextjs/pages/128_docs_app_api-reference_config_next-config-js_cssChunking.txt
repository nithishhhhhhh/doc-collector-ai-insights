CSS Chunking is a strategy used to improve the performance of your web application by splitting and re-ordering CSS files into chunks. This allows you to load only the CSS that is needed for a specific route, instead of loading all the application's CSS at once.
You can control how CSS files are chunked using the
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
experimental.cssChunking
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
option in your
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
next.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
file:
next.config.ts
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
const nextConfig = {
experimental: {
cssChunking: true, // default
} satisfies NextConfig
export default nextConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Options
[CODE_BLOCK_5]
(default)
: Next.js will try to merge CSS files whenever possible, determining explicit and implicit dependencies between files from import order to reduce the number of chunks and therefore the number of requests.
[CODE_BLOCK_6]
: Next.js will not attempt to merge or re-order your CSS files.
[CODE_BLOCK_7]
: Next.js will load CSS files in the correct order they are imported into your files, which can lead to more chunks and requests.
You may consider using
[CODE_BLOCK_8]
if you run into unexpected CSS behavior. For example, if you import
[CODE_BLOCK_9]
[CODE_BLOCK_10]
in different files using a different
[CODE_BLOCK_11]
order (
[CODE_BLOCK_12]
before
[CODE_BLOCK_13]
, or
[CODE_BLOCK_14]
before
[CODE_BLOCK_15]
[CODE_BLOCK_16]
will merge the files in any order and assume there are no dependencies between them. However, if
[CODE_BLOCK_17]
depends on
[CODE_BLOCK_18]
, you may want to use
[CODE_BLOCK_19]
to prevent the files from being merged, and instead, load them in the order they are imported - which can result in more chunks and requests.
For most applications, we recommend
[CODE_BLOCK_20]
as it leads to fewer requests and better performance.
