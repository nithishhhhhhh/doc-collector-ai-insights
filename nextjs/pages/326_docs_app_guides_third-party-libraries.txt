Third Party Libraries
How to optimize third-party libraries
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
@next/third-parties
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
is a library that provides a collection of components and utilities that improve the performance and developer experience of loading popular third-party libraries in your Next.js application.
All third-party integrations provided by
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
@next/third-parties
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
have been optimized for performance and ease of use.
Getting Started
To get started, install the
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
@next/third-parties
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
library:
Terminal
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
npm install @next/third-parties@latest next@latest
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
@next/third-parties
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
is currently an
experimental
library under active development. We recommend installing it with the
latest
canary
flags while we work on adding more third-party integrations.
Google Third-Parties
All supported third-party libraries from Google can be imported from
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
@next/third-parties/google
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Google Tag Manager
--- CODE BLOCK 8 ---
GoogleTagManager
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
component can be used to instantiate a
Google Tag Manager
container to your page. By default, it fetches the original inline script after hydration occurs on the page.
To load Google Tag Manager for all routes, include the component directly in your root layout and pass in your GTM container ID:
app/layout.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
import { GoogleTagManager } from '@next/third-parties/google'
export default function RootLayout({
children,
}: {
children: React.ReactNode
}) {
return (
<html lang="en">
<GoogleTagManager gtmId="GTM-XYZ" />
<body>{children}</body>
</html>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
To load Google Tag Manager for a single route, include the component in your page file:
app/page.js
--- CODE BLOCK 11 ---
import { GoogleTagManager } from '@next/third-parties/google'
export default function Page() {
return <GoogleTagManager gtmId="GTM-XYZ" />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Sending Events
--- CODE BLOCK 13 ---
sendGTMEvent
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
function can be used to track user interactions on your page by sending events
using the
--- CODE BLOCK 15 ---
<GoogleTagManager />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
object. For this function to work, the
--- CODE BLOCK 16 ---
'use client'
import { sendGTMEvent } from '@next/third-parties/google'
export function EventButton() {
return (
<div>
<button
onClick={() => sendGTMEvent({ event: 'buttonClicked', value: 'xyz' })}
Send Event
</button>
</div>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
component must be
included in either a parent layout, page, or component, or directly in the same file.
app/page.js
--- CODE BLOCK 17 ---
'use client'
import { sendGTMEvent } from '@next/third-parties/google'
export function EventButton() {
return (
<div>
<button
onClick={() => sendGTMEvent({ event: 'buttonClicked', value: 'xyz' })}
Send Event
</button>
</div>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Refer to the Tag Manager
developer
documentation
to learn about the
different variables and events that can be passed into the function.
Server-side Tagging
If you're using a server-side tag manager and serving
--- CODE BLOCK 22 ---
gtmScriptUrl
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
scripts from your tagging server you can

Recommendation
: If Google Tag Manager is already included in your application, you can
configure Google Analytics directly using it, rather than including Google Analytics as a separate
component. Refer to the
documentation
to learn more about the differences between Tag Manager and

Refer to the Google Analytics
developer
documentation

more about event parameters.
Tracking Pageviews
Google Analytics automatically tracks pageviews when the browser history state changes. This means
that client-side navigations between Next.js routes will send pageview data without any configuration.
To ensure that client-side navigations are being measured correctly, verify that the
“Enhanced
Measurement”
property is
enabled in your Admin panel and the
“Page changes based on browser history events”
checkbox is
selected.
Note
: If you decide to manually send pageview events, make sure to disable the default
pageview measurement to avoid having duplicate data. Refer to the Google Analytics
developer
documentation
to learn more.
