Next.js Docs
Welcome to the Next.js documentation!
What is Next.js?
Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.
It also automatically configures lower-level tools like bundlers and compilers. You can instead focus on building your product and shipping quickly.
Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications.
How to use the docs
The docs are organized into 4 sections:
Getting Started
: Step-by-step tutorials to help you create a new application and learn the core Next.js features.
Guides
: Tutorials on specific use cases, choose what's relevant to you.
API Reference
: Detailed technical reference for every feature.
Use the sidebar to navigate through the sections, or search (
[CODE_BLOCK_1]
[CODE_BLOCK_2]
) to quickly find a page.
App Router and Pages Router
Next.js has two different routers:
App Router
: The newer router that supports new React features like Server Components.
Pages Router
: The original router, still supported and being improved.
At the top of the sidebar, you'll notice a dropdown menu that allows you to switch between the
App Router
and the
Pages Router
docs.
