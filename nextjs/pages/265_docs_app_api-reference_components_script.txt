component requires the following properties.
--- CODE BLOCK 26 ---
import Script from 'next/script'

children,

}) {

<html lang="en">
<body>
{children}
<Script
src="https://example.com/script.js"
strategy="beforeInteractive"
</body>
</html>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
property is required unless an inline script is used.
Optional Props
--- CODE BLOCK 28 ---
beforeInteractive
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
component accepts a number of additional properties beyond those which are required.
--- CODE BLOCK 30 ---
beforeInteractive
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
The loading strategy of the script. There are four different strategies that can be used:
--- CODE BLOCK 31 ---
afterInteractive
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
: Load before any Next.js code and before any page hydration occurs.
--- CODE BLOCK 32 ---
afterInteractive
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
default
) Load early but after some hydration on the page occurs.
--- CODE BLOCK 33 ---
afterInteractive
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
: Load during browser idle time.
--- CODE BLOCK 34 ---
import Script from 'next/script'
export default function Page() {
return (
<Script src="https://example.com/script.js" strategy="afterInteractive" />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
: (experimental) Load in a web worker.
--- CODE BLOCK 35 ---
import Script from 'next/script'
export default function Page() {
return (
<Script src="https://example.com/script.js" strategy="afterInteractive" />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Scripts that load with the
--- CODE BLOCK 36 ---
afterInteractive
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
strategy are injected into the initial HTML from the server, downloaded before any Next.js module, and executed in the order they are placed.
Scripts denoted with this strategy are preloaded and fetched before any first-party code, but their execution
does not block page hydration from occurring
--- CODE BLOCK 40 ---
import Script from 'next/script'
export default function Page() {
return (
<Script src="https://example.com/script.js" strategy="lazyOnload" />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
scripts must be placed inside the root layout (
--- CODE BLOCK 41 ---
import Script from 'next/script'
export default function Page() {
return (
<Script src="https://example.com/script.js" strategy="lazyOnload" />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
) and are designed to load scripts that are needed by the entire site (i.e. the script will load when any page in the application has been loaded server-side).
This strategy should only be used for critical scripts that need to be fetched as soon as possible.
app/layout.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
--- CODE BLOCK 47 ---
nextScriptWorkers
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Good to know
: Scripts with
--- CODE BLOCK 49 ---
module.exports = {
experimental: {
nextScriptWorkers: true,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
will always be injected inside the
--- CODE BLOCK 50 ---
module.exports = {
experimental: {
nextScriptWorkers: true,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
of the HTML document regardless of where it's placed in the component.
Some examples of scripts that should be fetched as soon as possible with
--- CODE BLOCK 53 ---
import Script from 'next/script'
export default function Home() {
return (
<Script src="https://example.com/script.js" strategy="worker" />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
include:
Bot detectors
Cookie consent managers
--- CODE BLOCK 54 ---
import Script from 'next/script'
export default function Home() {
return (
<Script src="https://example.com/script.js" strategy="worker" />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Scripts that use the
--- CODE BLOCK 58 ---
beforeInteractive
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
strategy are injected into the HTML client-side and will load after some (or all) hydration occurs on the page.
This is the default strategy
of the Script component and should be used for any script that needs to load as soon as possible but not before any first-party Next.js code.
--- CODE BLOCK 60 ---
afterInteractive
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
scripts can be placed inside of any page or layout and will only load and execute when that page (or group of pages) is opened in the browser.
app/page.js
--- CODE BLOCK 63 ---
'use client'
import Script from 'next/script'
export default function Page() {
return (
<Script

onLoad={() => {
console.log(_.sample([1, 2, 3, 4]))

--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Scripts that use the
--- CODE BLOCK 73 ---
beforeInteractive
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
strategy are injected into the HTML client-side during browser idle time and will load after all resources on the page have been fetched. This strategy should be used for any background or low priority scripts that do not need to load early.
--- CODE BLOCK 75 ---
'use client'
import Script from 'next/script'
export default function Page() {
return (
<Script
src="https://example.com/script.js"

scripts can be placed inside of any page or layout and will only load and execute when that page (or group of pages) is opened in the browser.

beforeInteractive
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
strategy is not yet stable and does not yet work with the App Router. Use with caution.
Scripts that use the
--- CODE BLOCK 88 ---
next/script
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
strategy are off-loaded to a web worker in order to free up the main thread and ensure that only critical, first-party resources are processed on it. While this strategy can be used for any script, it is an advanced use case that is not guaranteed to support all third-party scripts.
To use

flag must be enabled in
[CODE_BLOCK_48]

Some third-party scripts require users to run JavaScript code once after the script has finished loading in order to instantiate content or call a function. If you are loading a script with either
[CODE_BLOCK_60]
[CODE_BLOCK_61]
as a loading strategy, you can execute code after it has loaded using the
[CODE_BLOCK_62]
property.
Here's an example of executing a lodash method only after the library has been loaded.

Warning:
[CODE_BLOCK_66]
does not yet work with Server Components and can only be used in Client Components.
Some third-party scripts require users to run JavaScript code after the script has finished loading and every time the component is mounted (after a route navigation for example). You can execute code after the script's load event when it first loads and then after every subsequent component re-mount using the
[CODE_BLOCK_67]
property.
Here's an example of how to re-instantiate a Google Maps JS embed every time the component is mounted:

loading strategy.
Sometimes it is helpful to catch when a script fails to load. These errors can be handled with the
