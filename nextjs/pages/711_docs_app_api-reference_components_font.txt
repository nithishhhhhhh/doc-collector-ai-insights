automatically optimizes your fonts (including custom fonts) and removes external network requests for improved privacy and performance.
It includes
built-in automatic self-hosting
for any font file. This means you can optimally load web fonts with no
layout shift
You can also conveniently use all
Google Fonts
. CSS and font files are downloaded at build time and self-hosted with the rest of your static assets.
No requests are sent to Google by the browser.

Examples
Google Fonts
To use a Google font, import it from
[CODE_BLOCK_133]
as a function. We recommend using
variable fonts
for the best performance and flexibility.
app/layout.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_134]
If you can't use a variable font, you will
need to specify a weight
app/layout.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_136]
You can specify multiple weights and/or styles by using an array:
app/layout.js
[CODE_BLOCK_138]
Good to know
: Use an underscore (_) for font names with multiple words. E.g.
[CODE_BLOCK_140]
should be imported as
[CODE_BLOCK_141]
Specifying a subset
Google Fonts are automatically
subset
. This reduces the size of the font file and improves performance. You'll need to define which of these subsets you want to preload. Failing to specify any subsets while
[CODE_BLOCK_142]
[CODE_BLOCK_143]
will result in a warning.
This can be done by adding it to the function call:
app/layout.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_144]
View the
Font API Reference
for more information.
Using Multiple Fonts
You can import and use multiple fonts in your application. There are two approaches you can take.
The first approach is to create a utility function that exports a font, imports it, and applies its
[CODE_BLOCK_146]
where needed. This ensures the font is preloaded only when it's rendered:
app/fonts.ts
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_147]
app/layout.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_149]
app/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_151]
In the example above,
[CODE_BLOCK_153]
will be applied globally, and
[CODE_BLOCK_154]
can be imported and applied as needed.
Alternatively, you can create a
CSS variable
and use it with your preferred CSS solution:
app/layout.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_155]
app/global.css
[CODE_BLOCK_157]
In the example above,
[CODE_BLOCK_159]
will be applied globally, and any
[CODE_BLOCK_160]
tags will be styled with
[CODE_BLOCK_161]
Recommendation
: Use multiple fonts conservatively since each new font is an additional resource the client has to download.
Local Fonts
Import
[CODE_BLOCK_162]
and specify the
[CODE_BLOCK_163]
of your local font file. We recommend using
variable fonts
for the best performance and flexibility.
app/layout.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_164]
If you want to use multiple files for a single font family,
[CODE_BLOCK_166]
can be an array:
[CODE_BLOCK_167]
View the
Font API Reference
for more information.
With Tailwind CSS
[CODE_BLOCK_169]
integrates seamlessly with
Tailwind CSS
using
CSS variables
In the example below, we use the
[CODE_BLOCK_170]
[CODE_BLOCK_171]
fonts from
[CODE_BLOCK_172]
(you can use any Google Font or Local Font). Use the
[CODE_BLOCK_173]
option to define a CSS variable name, such as
[CODE_BLOCK_174]
[CODE_BLOCK_175]
for these fonts, respectively. Then, apply
[CODE_BLOCK_176]
[CODE_BLOCK_177]
to include the CSS variables in your HTML document.
Good to know
: You can add these variables to the
[CODE_BLOCK_178]
[CODE_BLOCK_179]
tag, depending on your preference, styling needs or project requirements.
app/layout.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_180]
Finally, add the CSS variable to your
Tailwind CSS config
Tailwind CSS v4
As of
Tailwind v4
, there is zero configuration required by default. If you do need to configure Tailwind, you can follow the
official documentation
for configuring the global CSS file.
global.css
[CODE_BLOCK_182]
Tailwind CSS v3
tailwind.config.js
[CODE_BLOCK_184]
You can now use the
[CODE_BLOCK_186]
[CODE_BLOCK_187]
utility classes to apply the font to your elements.
[CODE_BLOCK_188]
Applying Styles
You can apply the font styles in three ways:
[CODE_BLOCK_190]
[CODE_BLOCK_191]
CSS Variables
[CODE_BLOCK_192]
Returns a read-only CSS
[CODE_BLOCK_193]
for the loaded font to be passed to an HTML element.
[CODE_BLOCK_194]
[CODE_BLOCK_196]
Returns a read-only CSS
[CODE_BLOCK_197]
object for the loaded font to be passed to an HTML element, including
[CODE_BLOCK_198]
to access the font family name and fallback fonts.
[CODE_BLOCK_199]
CSS Variables
If you would like to set your styles in an external style sheet and specify additional options there, use the CSS variable method.
In addition to importing the font, also import the CSS file where the CSS variable is defined and set the variable option of the font loader object as follows:
app/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_201]
To use the font, set the
[CODE_BLOCK_203]
of the parent container of the text you would like to style to the font loader's
[CODE_BLOCK_204]
value and the
[CODE_BLOCK_205]
of the text to the
[CODE_BLOCK_206]
property from the external CSS file.
app/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_207]
Define the
[CODE_BLOCK_209]
selector class in the
[CODE_BLOCK_210]
CSS file as follows:
styles/component.module.css
[CODE_BLOCK_211]
In the example above, the text
[CODE_BLOCK_213]
is styled using the
[CODE_BLOCK_214]
font and the generated font fallback with
[CODE_BLOCK_215]
[CODE_BLOCK_216]
Using a font definitions file
Every time you call the
[CODE_BLOCK_217]
or Google font function, that font will be hosted as one instance in your application. Therefore, if you need to use the same font in multiple places, you should load it in one place and import the related font object where you need it. This is done using a font definitions file.
For example, create a
[CODE_BLOCK_218]
file in a
[CODE_BLOCK_219]
folder at the root of your app directory.
Then, specify your font definitions as follows:
styles/fonts.ts
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_220]
You can now use these definitions in your code as follows:
app/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_222]
To make it easier to access the font definitions in your code, you can define a path alias in your
[CODE_BLOCK_224]
[CODE_BLOCK_225]
files as follows:
tsconfig.json
[CODE_BLOCK_226]
You can now import any font definition as follows:
app/about/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_228]
Preloading
When a font function is called on a page of your site, it is not globally available and preloaded on all routes. Rather, the font is only preloaded on the related routes based on the type of file where it is used:
If it's a
unique page
, it is preloaded on the unique route for that page.
If it's a
layout
, it is preloaded on all the routes wrapped by the layout.
If it's the
root layout
, it is preloaded on all routes.
