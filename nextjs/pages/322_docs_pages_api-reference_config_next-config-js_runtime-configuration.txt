Runtime Config
You are currently viewing the documentation for Pages Router.
Runtime Config
Warning:
This feature is deprecated.
We recommend using
environment variables
instead, which also can support reading runtime values.
You can run code on server startup using the
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
next.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
function
This feature does not work with
Automatic Static Optimization
Output File Tracing
, or
React Server Components
To add runtime configuration to your app, open
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
publicRuntimeConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
and add the
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
serverRuntimeConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
module.exports = {
serverRuntimeConfig: {
// Will only be available on the server side
mySecret: 'secret',
secondSecret: process.env.SECOND_SECRET, // Pass through env variables
publicRuntimeConfig: {
// Will be available on both server and client
staticFolder: '/static',
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
configs:
next.config.js
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
module.exports = {
serverRuntimeConfig: {
// Will only be available on the server side
mySecret: 'secret',
secondSecret: process.env.SECOND_SECRET, // Pass through env variables
publicRuntimeConfig: {
// Will be available on both server and client
staticFolder: '/static',
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Place any server-only runtime config under
--- CODE BLOCK 8 ---
publicRuntimeConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Anything accessible to both client and server-side code should be under
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
publicRuntimeConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
A page that relies on
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
getInitialProps
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
must
--- CODE BLOCK 11 ---
getServerSideProps
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 12 ---
getInitialProps
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
or your application must have a
Custom App
with
--- CODE BLOCK 13 ---
next/config
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
to opt-out of
Automatic Static Optimization
. Runtime configuration won't be available to any page (or component in a page) without being server-side rendered.
To get access to the runtime configs in your app use
--- CODE BLOCK 14 ---
import getConfig from 'next/config'
import Image from 'next/image'
// Only holds serverRuntimeConfig and publicRuntimeConfig
const { serverRuntimeConfig, publicRuntimeConfig } = getConfig()
// Will only be available on the server-side
console.log(serverRuntimeConfig.mySecret)
// Will be available on both server-side and client-side
console.log(publicRuntimeConfig.staticFolder)
function MyImage() {
return (
<div>
<Image
src={`${publicRuntimeConfig.staticFolder}/logo.png`}
alt="logo"
layout="fill"
</div>
export default MyImage
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, like so:
--- CODE BLOCK 15 ---
import getConfig from 'next/config'
import Image from 'next/image'
// Only holds serverRuntimeConfig and publicRuntimeConfig
const { serverRuntimeConfig, publicRuntimeConfig } = getConfig()
// Will only be available on the server-side
console.log(serverRuntimeConfig.mySecret)
// Will be available on both server-side and client-side
console.log(publicRuntimeConfig.staticFolder)
function MyImage() {
return (
<div>
<Image
src={`${publicRuntimeConfig.staticFolder}/logo.png`}
alt="logo"
layout="fill"
</div>
export default MyImage
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
