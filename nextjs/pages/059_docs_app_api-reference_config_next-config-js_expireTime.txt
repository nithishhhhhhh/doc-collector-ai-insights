expireTime
You can specify a custom
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
stale-while-revalidate
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
expire time for CDNs to consume in the
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
Cache-Control
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
header for ISR enabled pages.
Open
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
next.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
and add the
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
module.exports = {
// one hour in seconds
expireTime: 3600,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
config:
next.config.js
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
module.exports = {
// one hour in seconds
expireTime: 3600,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Now when sending the
--- CODE BLOCK 8 ---
Cache-Control
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
header the expire time will be calculated depending on the specific revalidate period.
For example, if you have a revalidate of 15 minutes on a path and the expire time is one hour the generated
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
s-maxage=900, stale-while-revalidate=2700
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
header will be
[CODE_BLOCK_9]
so that it can stay stale for 15 minutes less than the configured expire time.
