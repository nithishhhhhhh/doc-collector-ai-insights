File-system conventions
Route Groups
Route Groups
Route Groups are a folder convention that let you organize routes by category or team.
Convention
A route group can be created by wrapping a folder's name in parenthesis:
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
(folderName)
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
This convention indicates the folder is for organizational purposes and should
not be included
in the route's URL path.
Use cases
Organizing routes by team, concern, or feature.
Defining multiple
root layouts
Opting specific route segments into sharing a layout, while keeping others out.
Caveats
Full page load
: If you navigate between routes that use different root layouts, it'll trigger a full page reload. For example, navigating from
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
app/(shop)/layout.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
that uses
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
app/(marketing)/layout.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
(marketing)/about/page.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
that uses
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
(shop)/about/page.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
. This
only
applies to multiple root layouts.
Conflicting paths
: Routes in different groups should not resolve to the same URL path. For example,
[CODE_BLOCK_6]
[CODE_BLOCK_7]
would both resolve to
[CODE_BLOCK_8]
and cause an error.
Top-level root layout
: If you use multiple root layouts without a top-level
[CODE_BLOCK_9]
file, make sure your home route (/) is defined within one of the route groups, e.g. app/(marketing)/page.js.
