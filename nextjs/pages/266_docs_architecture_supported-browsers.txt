Supported Browsers
Supported Browsers
Next.js supports
modern browsers
with zero configuration.
Chrome 64+
Edge 79+
Firefox 67+
Opera 51+
Safari 12+
Browserslist
If you would like to target specific browsers or features, Next.js supports
Browserslist
configuration in your
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
package.json
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
file. Next.js uses the following Browserslist configuration by default:
package.json
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
"browserslist": [
"chrome 64",
"edge 79",
"firefox 67",
"opera 51",
"safari 12"
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Polyfills
We inject
widely used polyfills
, including:
fetch()
— Replacing:
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
whatwg-fetch
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
object-assign
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
— Replacing: the
--- CODE BLOCK 8 ---
object.assign
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
package (Node.js API)
Object.assign()
— Replacing:
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
core-js/object/assign
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
[CODE_BLOCK_8]
, and
[CODE_BLOCK_9]
If any of your dependencies include these polyfills, they’ll be eliminated automatically from the production build to avoid duplication.
In addition, to reduce bundle size, Next.js will only load these polyfills for browsers that require them. The majority of the web traffic globally will not download these polyfills.
Custom Polyfills
If your own code or any external npm dependencies require features not supported by your target browsers (such as IE 11), you need to add polyfills yourself.
In this case, you should add a top-level import for the
specific polyfill
you need in your
Custom
[CODE_BLOCK_10]
or the individual component.
