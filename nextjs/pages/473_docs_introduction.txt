AI SDK
The AI SDK is the TypeScript toolkit designed to help developers build AI-powered applications and agents with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more.
Why use the AI SDK?
Integrating large language models (LLMs) into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider you use.
The AI SDK standardizes integrating artificial intelligence (AI) models across
supported providers
. This enables developers to focus on building great AI applications, not waste time on technical details.
For example, hereâ€™s how you can generate text with various models using the AI SDK:
OpenAI
Anthropic
Google
Custom
import
{ generateText }
from
"ai"
import
{ xai }
from
"@ai-sdk/xai"
const
{ text } =
await
generateText
model:
xai(
"grok-3-beta"
prompt:
"What is love?"
Love is a universal emotion that is characterized by feelings of affection, attachment, and warmth towards someone or something. It is a complex and multifaceted experience that can take many different forms, including romantic love, familial love, platonic love, and self-love.
The AI SDK has two main libraries:
AI SDK Core
A unified API for generating text, structured objects, tool calls, and building agents with LLMs.
AI SDK UI
A set of framework-agnostic hooks for quickly building chat and generative user interface.
Model Providers
The AI SDK supports
multiple model providers

(for Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Claude etc.)
You can access the entire AI SDK documentation in Markdown format at
ai-sdk.dev/llms.txt
. This can be used to ask any LLM (assuming it has a big enough context window) questions about the AI SDK based on the most up-to-date documentation.
Example Usage
For instance, to prompt an LLM with questions about the AI SDK:
Copy the documentation contents from
ai-sdk.dev/llms.txt
Use the following prompt format:
