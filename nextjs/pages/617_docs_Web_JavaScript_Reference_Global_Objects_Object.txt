--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
Object.prototype
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
type represents one of
JavaScript's data types
. It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. Objects can be created using the
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
Object.prototype
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
constructor or the
object initializer / literal syntax
Description
Nearly all
objects
in JavaScript are instances of
--- CODE BLOCK 8 ---
Object.prototype
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
; a typical object inherits properties (including methods) from
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
Object.prototype
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, although these properties may be shadowed (a.k.a. overridden). The only objects that don't inherit from
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
Object.prototype
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
are those with
--- CODE BLOCK 12 ---
Object.prototype
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
prototype
, or descended from other
--- CODE BLOCK 13 ---
Object.prototype
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
prototype objects.
Changes to the
--- CODE BLOCK 17 ---
toLocaleString()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
object are seen by
objects through prototype chaining, unless the properties and methods subject to those changes are overridden further along the prototype chain. This provides a very powerful although potentially dangerous mechanism to override or extend object behavior. To make it more secure,
--- CODE BLOCK 20 ---
__defineGetter__()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
is the only object in the core JavaScript language that has
immutable prototype
— the prototype of
--- CODE BLOCK 21 ---
__defineSetter__()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
is always
--- CODE BLOCK 22 ---
__lookupGetter__()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
and not changeable.
Object prototype properties
You should avoid calling any of the
--- CODE BLOCK 23 ---
__lookupSetter__()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
methods directly from the instance, especially those that are not intended to be polymorphic (i.e., only its initial behavior makes sense and no descending object could override it in a meaningful way). All objects descending from
--- CODE BLOCK 24 ---
Object.defineProperty()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
may define a custom own property that has the same name, but with entirely different semantics from what you expect. Furthermore, these properties are not inherited by
--- CODE BLOCK 25 ---
Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
-prototype objects
. All modern JavaScript utilities for working with objects are
static
. More specifically:
--- CODE BLOCK 27 ---
Object.getPrototypeOf()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 28 ---
Object.setPrototypeOf()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, and
--- CODE BLOCK 29 ---
propertyIsEnumerable()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
exist to be polymorphic and you should expect the object to define its own implementation with sensible behaviors, so you can call them as instance methods. However,
--- CODE BLOCK 30 ---
hasOwnProperty()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 31 ---
Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
are usually implicitly called through
type conversion
and you don't need to call them yourself in your code.
--- CODE BLOCK 32 ---
Object.hasOwn()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 33 ---
isPrototypeOf()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 36 ---
Object.prototype
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, and
--- CODE BLOCK 38 ---
Object.prototype
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
are deprecated and should not be used. Use the static alternatives
--- CODE BLOCK 39 ---
const obj = {
foo: 1,
// You should not define such a method on your own object,
// but you may not be able to prevent it from happening if
// you are receiving the object from external input
propertyIsEnumerable() {
return false;
obj.propertyIsEnumerable("foo"); // false; unexpected result
Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(obj, "foo"); // true; expected result
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 40 ---
const obj = {
foo: 1,
// You should not define such a method on your own object,
// but you may not be able to prevent it from happening if
// you are receiving the object from external input
propertyIsEnumerable() {
return false;
obj.propertyIsEnumerable("foo"); // false; unexpected result
Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(obj, "foo"); // true; expected result
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
instead.
--- CODE BLOCK 41 ---
Map.prototype.delete()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
property is deprecated and should not be used. The
--- CODE BLOCK 43 ---
Object.prototype
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 45 ---
Object.create(null)
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
alternatives are static methods.
--- CODE BLOCK 46 ---
__proto__: null
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 48 ---
Object.prototype.__proto__
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
methods can be replaced with the
--- CODE BLOCK 50 ---
Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, null)
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 51 ---
const obj = Object.create(null);
const obj2 = { __proto__: null };
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
static methods, respectively.
--- CODE BLOCK 52 ---
const obj = Object.create(null);
const obj2 = { __proto__: null };
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
method can usually be replaced with
--- CODE BLOCK 54 ---
Object.prototype
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, if you are checking the
--- CODE BLOCK 55 ---
Object.prototype.toString()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
property of a constructor.
In case where a semantically equivalent static method doesn't exist, or if you really want to use the
--- CODE BLOCK 56 ---
const normalObj = {}; // create a normal object
const nullProtoObj = Object.create(null); // create an object with "null" prototype
console.log(`normalObj is: ${normalObj}`); // shows "normalObj is: [object Object]"
console.log(`nullProtoObj is: ${nullProtoObj}`); // throws error: Cannot convert object to primitive value
alert(normalObj); // shows [object Object]
alert(nullProtoObj); // throws error: Cannot convert object to primitive value
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
method, you should directly
--- CODE BLOCK 57 ---
const normalObj = {}; // create a normal object
const nullProtoObj = Object.create(null); // create an object with "null" prototype
console.log(`normalObj is: ${normalObj}`); // shows "normalObj is: [object Object]"
console.log(`nullProtoObj is: ${nullProtoObj}`); // throws error: Cannot convert object to primitive value
alert(normalObj); // shows [object Object]
alert(nullProtoObj); // throws error: Cannot convert object to primitive value
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 58 ---
normalObj.valueOf(); // shows {}
nullProtoObj.valueOf(); // throws error: nullProtoObj.valueOf is not a function
normalObj.hasOwnProperty("p"); // shows "true"
nullProtoObj.hasOwnProperty("p"); // throws error: nullProtoObj.hasOwnProperty is not a function
normalObj.constructor; // shows "Object() { [native code] }"
nullProtoObj.constructor; // shows "undefined"
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
method on your target object instead, to prevent the object from having an overriding property that produces unexpected results.
Copy to Clipboard
--- CODE BLOCK 59 ---
normalObj.valueOf(); // shows {}
nullProtoObj.valueOf(); // throws error: nullProtoObj.valueOf is not a function
normalObj.hasOwnProperty("p"); // shows "true"
nullProtoObj.hasOwnProperty("p"); // throws error: nullProtoObj.hasOwnProperty is not a function
normalObj.constructor; // shows "Object() { [native code] }"
nullProtoObj.constructor; // shows "undefined"
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Deleting a property from an object
There isn't any method in an Object itself to delete its own properties (such as
--- CODE BLOCK 62 ---
nullProtoObj.toString = Object.prototype.toString; // since new object lacks toString, add the original generic one back
console.log(nullProtoObj.toString()); // shows "[object Object]"
console.log(`nullProtoObj is: ${nullProtoObj}`); // shows "nullProtoObj is: [object Object]"
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
). To do so, one must use the
--- CODE BLOCK 65 ---
nullProtoObj
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
operator.
null-prototype objects
Almost all objects in JavaScript ultimately inherit from
--- CODE BLOCK 66 ---
nullProtoObj
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
(see
inheritance and the prototype chain
). However, you may create
--- CODE BLOCK 68 ---
Object.setPrototypeOf(nullProtoObj, Object.prototype)
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
-prototype objects using
--- CODE BLOCK 70 ---
Object.prototype
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
or the
object initializer syntax
with
--- CODE BLOCK 71 ---
const ages = { alice: 18, bob: 27 };
function hasPerson(name) {
return name in ages;
function getAge(name) {
return ages[name];
hasPerson("hasOwnProperty"); // true
getAge("toString"); // [Function: toString]
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
(note: the
--- CODE BLOCK 72 ---
const ages = { alice: 18, bob: 27 };
function hasPerson(name) {
return name in ages;
function getAge(name) {
return ages[name];
hasPerson("hasOwnProperty"); // true
getAge("toString"); // [Function: toString]
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
key in object literals is different from the deprecated
--- CODE BLOCK 75 ---
const ages = Object.create(null, {
alice: { value: 18, enumerable: true },
bob: { value: 27, enumerable: true },
hasPerson("hasOwnProperty"); // false
getAge("toString"); // undefined
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
property). You can also change the prototype of an existing object to
--- CODE BLOCK 76 ---
const ages = Object.create(null, {
alice: { value: 18, enumerable: true },
bob: { value: 27, enumerable: true },
hasPerson("hasOwnProperty"); // false
getAge("toString"); // undefined
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
by calling
--- CODE BLOCK 77 ---
Object.prototype
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Copy to Clipboard
--- CODE BLOCK 78 ---
Object.prototype
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
An object with a
--- CODE BLOCK 80 ---
const user = {};
// A malicious script:
Object.prototype.authenticated = true;
// Unexpectedly allowing unauthenticated user to pass through
if (user.authenticated) {
// access confidential data
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
prototype can behave in unexpected ways, because it doesn't inherit any object methods from
--- CODE BLOCK 82 ---
Object.groupBy()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
. This is especially true when debugging, since common object-property converting/detecting utility functions may generate errors, or lose information (especially if using silent error-traps that ignore errors).
For example, the lack of
--- CODE BLOCK 84 ---
indices.groups
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
often makes debugging intractable:
Copy to Clipboard
--- CODE BLOCK 85 ---
RegExp.prototype.exec()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Other methods will fail as well.
Copy to Clipboard
--- CODE BLOCK 87 ---
[Symbol.unscopables]
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
We can add the
--- CODE BLOCK 90 ---
import * as ns from "module";
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
method back to the null-prototype object by assigning it one:
Copy to Clipboard
--- CODE BLOCK 93 ---
Object.prototype
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Unlike normal objects, in which
--- CODE BLOCK 103 ---
Object.prototype.valueOf()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
is on the object's prototype, the
--- CODE BLOCK 104 ---
Object.prototype.valueOf.call(x)
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
method here is an own property of
--- CODE BLOCK 117 ---
Object.keys()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
. This is because
--- CODE BLOCK 124 ---
Object.assign()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
has no (
--- CODE BLOCK 125 ---
Object.create()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
) prototype.
You can also revert a null-prototype object back to an ordinary object using
--- CODE BLOCK 126 ---
Object.defineProperties()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
In practice, objects with
--- CODE BLOCK 127 ---
Object.defineProperty()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
prototype are usually used as a cheap substitute for
maps
. The presence of
--- CODE BLOCK 128 ---
Object.entries()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
properties will cause some bugs:
Copy to Clipboard
--- CODE BLOCK 129 ---
[key, value]
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Using a null-prototype object removes this hazard without introducing too much complexity to the
--- CODE BLOCK 131 ---
Object.fromEntries()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 132 ---
[key, value]
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
functions:
Copy to Clipboard
--- CODE BLOCK 133 ---
Object.entries
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
In such case, the addition of any method should be done cautiously, as they can be confused with the other key-value pairs stored as data.
Making your object not inherit from
--- CODE BLOCK 135 ---
Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
also prevents prototype pollution attacks. If a malicious script adds a property to
--- CODE BLOCK 136 ---
Object.getOwnPropertyNames()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, it will be accessible on every object in your program, except objects that have null prototype.
Copy to Clipboard
--- CODE BLOCK 137 ---
Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
JavaScript also has built-in APIs that produce
--- CODE BLOCK 139 ---
[[Prototype]]
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
-prototype objects, especially those that use objects as ad hoc key-value collections. For example:
The return value of
--- CODE BLOCK 140 ---
Object.groupBy()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 141 ---
Object.hasOwn()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 144 ---
Object.is()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
properties of the result of
--- CODE BLOCK 146 ---
IsLooselyEqual
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 148 ---
IsStrictlyEqual
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
(all
--- CODE BLOCK 150 ---
Object.isExtensible()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
objects should have
--- CODE BLOCK 151 ---
Object.isFrozen()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
-prototype)
--- CODE BLOCK 152 ---
Object.isSealed()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Module namespace objects, obtained through
--- CODE BLOCK 153 ---
Object.keys()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 154 ---
Object.preventExtensions()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
The term "
--- CODE BLOCK 155 ---
Object.seal()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
-prototype object" often also includes any object without
--- CODE BLOCK 156 ---
Object.setPrototypeOf()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
in its prototype chain. Such objects can be created with
--- CODE BLOCK 157 ---
[[Prototype]]
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
when using classes.
Object coercion
Many built-in operations that expect objects first coerce their arguments to objects.
The operation
can be summarized as follows:
Objects are returned as-is.
--- CODE BLOCK 158 ---
Object.values()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 159 ---
Object.prototype
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
throw a
--- CODE BLOCK 161 ---
Object.prototype.__proto__
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 162 ---
Object.prototype.constructor
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 165 ---
constructor
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 166 ---
Constructor.prototype
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 167 ---
Object.prototype.__defineGetter__()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 168 ---
Object.prototype.__defineSetter__()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
primitives are wrapped into their corresponding object wrappers.
There are two ways to achieve nearly the same effect in JavaScript.
--- CODE BLOCK 169 ---
Object.prototype.__lookupGetter__()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 170 ---
Object.prototype.__lookupSetter__()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
does exactly the object coercion steps explained above to convert
--- CODE BLOCK 171 ---
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 172 ---
Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
function:
--- CODE BLOCK 173 ---
Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
uses the same algorithm to convert
--- CODE BLOCK 174 ---
Object.prototype.toLocaleString()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, except that
--- CODE BLOCK 176 ---
Object.prototype.toString()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 177 ---
Object.prototype.valueOf()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
don't throw a
--- CODE BLOCK 179 ---
const o1 = new Object();
const o2 = new Object(undefined);
const o3 = new Object(null);
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, but return a plain object.
Places that use object coercion include:
--- CODE BLOCK 180 ---
const o1 = new Object();
const o2 = new Object(undefined);
const o3 = new Object(null);
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
parameter of
--- CODE BLOCK 186 ---
// Equivalent to const o1 = new Boolean(true)
const o1 = new Object(true);
// No equivalent because BigInt() can't be called as a constructor,
// and calling it as a regular function won't create an object
const o2 = new Object(1n);
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
loops.
--- CODE BLOCK 187 ---
// Equivalent to const o1 = new Boolean(true)
const o1 = new Object(true);
// No equivalent because BigInt() can't be called as a constructor,
// and calling it as a regular function won't create an object
const o2 = new Object(1n);
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
value of
--- CODE BLOCK 188 ---
Object.prototype
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
methods.
Parameters of
--- CODE BLOCK 191 ---
Node.prototype
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
methods such as
--- CODE BLOCK 192 ---
Function.prototype
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Auto-boxing when a property is accessed on a primitive value, since primitives do not have properties.
--- CODE BLOCK 193 ---
const current = Object.prototype.valueOf;
// Since my property "-prop-value" is cross-cutting and isn't always
// on the same prototype chain, I want to modify Object.prototype:
Object.prototype.valueOf = function (...args) {
if (Object.hasOwn(this, "-prop-value")) {
return this["-prop-value"];
// It doesn't look like one of my objects, so let's fall back on
// the default behavior by reproducing the current behavior as best we can.
// The apply behaves like "super" in some other languages.
// Even though valueOf() doesn't take arguments, some other hook may.
return current.apply(this, args);
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
value when calling a non-strict function. Primitives are boxed while
--- CODE BLOCK 194 ---
const current = Object.prototype.valueOf;
// Since my property "-prop-value" is cross-cutting and isn't always
// on the same prototype chain, I want to modify Object.prototype:
Object.prototype.valueOf = function (...args) {
if (Object.hasOwn(this, "-prop-value")) {
return this["-prop-value"];
// It doesn't look like one of my objects, so let's fall back on
// the default behavior by reproducing the current behavior as best we can.
// The apply behaves like "super" in some other languages.
// Even though valueOf() doesn't take arguments, some other hook may.
return current.apply(this, args);

are replaced with the
global object
Unlike
conversion to primitives

Examples
Constructing empty objects
The following example creates empty objects using the
[CODE_BLOCK_178]
keyword with different arguments:
Copy to Clipboard
[CODE_BLOCK_179]
Using Object() constructor to turn primitives into an Object of their respective type
You can use the
[CODE_BLOCK_181]
constructor to create an object wrapper of a primitive value.
The following examples create variables
[CODE_BLOCK_182]
[CODE_BLOCK_183]
which are objects storing
[CODE_BLOCK_184]
[CODE_BLOCK_185]
values:
Copy to Clipboard
[CODE_BLOCK_186]
Object prototypes
When altering the behavior of existing
[CODE_BLOCK_188]
methods, consider injecting code by wrapping your extension before or after the existing logic. For example, this (untested) code will pre-conditionally execute custom logic before the built-in logic or someone else's extension is executed.
When modifying prototypes with hooks, pass
[CODE_BLOCK_189]
and the arguments (the call state) to the current behavior by calling
[CODE_BLOCK_190]
on the function. This pattern can be used for any prototype, such as
[CODE_BLOCK_191]
[CODE_BLOCK_192]
, etc.

[CODE_BLOCK_193]
Warning:
Modifying the
[CODE_BLOCK_195]
property of any built-in constructor is considered a bad practice and risks forward compatibility.
