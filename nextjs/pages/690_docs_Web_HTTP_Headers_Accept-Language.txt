================================================================================

The HTTP
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
Accept-Language
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
request header
indicates the natural language and locale that the client prefers.
The server uses
content negotiation
to select one of the proposals and informs the client of the choice with the
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
Content-Language
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
response header.
Browsers set required values for this header according to their active user interface language.
Users can also configure additional preferred languages through browser settings.
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
Accept-Language
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
header generally lists the same locales as the
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
navigator.languages
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
property, with decreasing
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
Accept-Language
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
values (
quality values
). Some browsers, like Chrome and Safari, add language-only fallback tags in
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
en-US,en;q=0.9,zh-CN;q=0.8,zh;q=0.7
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
. For example,
--- CODE BLOCK 8 ---
navigator.languages
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
when
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
["en-US", "zh-CN"]
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
Accept-Language
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
. For privacy purposes (reducing
fingerprinting
), both
--- CODE BLOCK 11 ---
navigator.languages
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 12 ---
Accept-Language
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
may not include the full list of user preferences. For example, in Safari (always) and Chrome's incognito mode, only one language is listed.
This header serves as a hint when the server cannot determine the target content language otherwise (for example, use a specific URL that depends on an explicit user decision).
The server should never override an explicit user language choice. The content of
--- CODE BLOCK 13 ---
406 Not Acceptable
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
is often out of a user's control (when traveling, for instance).
A user may also want to visit a page in a language different from the user interface language.
The server may send back a
--- CODE BLOCK 14 ---
Accept-Language
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
error code when unable to serve content in a matching language, but this is rarely implemented.
Servers often ignore the
--- CODE BLOCK 19 ---
Accept-Language: <language>
Accept-Language: *
// Multiple types, weighted with the quality value syntax:
Accept-Language: fr-CH, fr;q=0.9, en;q=0.8, de;q=0.7, *;q=0.5
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
header in such cases and send a successful response with the most appropriate resource instead for a better user experience.

A language tag (which is sometimes referred to as a "locale identifier").
This consists of a 2-3 letter base language tag that indicates a language, optionally followed by additional subtags separated by

The most common extra information is the country or region variant (like
[CODE_BLOCK_23]
[CODE_BLOCK_24]
) or the type of alphabet to use (like
[CODE_BLOCK_25]
Other variants, like the type of orthography (
[CODE_BLOCK_26]
), are usually not used in the context of this header.
[CODE_BLOCK_27]
(wildcard)
Any language not matched by any other language present in the
[CODE_BLOCK_28]
field.
[CODE_BLOCK_29]
(q-factor weighting)
Any value placed in an order of preference expressed using a relative
quality value
called

The quality value defaults to
