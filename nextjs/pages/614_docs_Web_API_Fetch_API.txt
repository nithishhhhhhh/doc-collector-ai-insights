The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It is a more powerful and flexible replacement for
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
XMLHttpRequest
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Concepts and usage
The Fetch API uses
--- CODE BLOCK 15 ---
FetchEvent.respondWith()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 16 ---
Window.fetch()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
objects (and other things involved with network requests), as well as related concepts such as CORS and the HTTP Origin header semantics.
For making a request and fetching a resource, use the
--- CODE BLOCK 17 ---
WorkerGlobalScope.fetch()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
method. It is a global method in both
[CODE_BLOCK_5]
[CODE_BLOCK_6]
contexts. This makes it available in pretty much any context you might want to fetch resources in.
[CODE_BLOCK_7]
method takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch. It returns a
[CODE_BLOCK_8]
that resolves to the
[CODE_BLOCK_9]
to that request — as soon as the server responds with headers —
even if the server response is an HTTP error status
. You can also optionally pass in an
[CODE_BLOCK_10]
options object as the second argument (see
[CODE_BLOCK_11]
Once a
[CODE_BLOCK_12]
is retrieved, there are a number of methods available to define what the body content is and how it should be handled.
You can create a request and response directly using the
[CODE_BLOCK_13]
[CODE_BLOCK_14]
constructors, but it's uncommon to do this directly. Instead, these are more likely to be created as results of other API actions (for example,
[CODE_BLOCK_15]
from service workers).
