--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
PerformanceNavigationTiming
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
interface provides methods and properties to store and retrieve metrics regarding the browser's document navigation events. For example, this interface can be used to determine how much time it takes to load or unload a document.
Only the current document is included in the performance timeline, so there is only one
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
PerformanceNavigationTiming
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
object in the performance timeline. It inherits all of the properties and methods of
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
PerformanceResourceTiming
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
PerformanceEntry
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
PerformanceEntry
PerformanceResourceTiming
PerformanceNavigationTiming
The following diagram shows all of the timestamp properties defined in
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---

Instance properties
This interface extends the following
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
PerformanceEntry
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
properties by qualifying and constraining them as follows:
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
PerformanceEntry.entryType
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Read only
Returns
--- CODE BLOCK 8 ---
"navigation"
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
PerformanceEntry.name
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Read only
Returns the
document's URL
Note that
text fragments
, and any other fragment directives, are stripped from the URL.
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
PerformanceEntry.startTime
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Read only
Returns a
--- CODE BLOCK 11 ---
DOMHighResTimeStamp

--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 15 ---
PerformanceNavigationTiming.loadEventEnd
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Read only
Returns a
--- CODE BLOCK 16 ---

--- CODE BLOCK 17 ---
PerformanceResourceTiming
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 18 ---
PerformanceResourceTiming.initiatorType
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
