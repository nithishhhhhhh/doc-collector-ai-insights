Why This Error Occurred
In versions prior to 6.x the

component (every page inside the
[CODE_BLOCK_3]
directory).
The reason this is going away is that we want to make things very predictable and explicit. Having a magical url property coming out of nowhere doesn't aid that goal.
Note
: ⚠️ In some cases using React Dev Tools may trigger this warning even if you do not reference
[CODE_BLOCK_4]
anywhere in your code. Try temporarily disabling the extension and see if the warning persists.
Possible Ways to Fix It
Since Next 5 we provide a way to explicitly inject the Next.js router object into pages and all their descending components.
[CODE_BLOCK_5]
property that is injected will hold the same values as
[CODE_BLOCK_6]
, like
[CODE_BLOCK_7]
[CODE_BLOCK_8]
, and
[CODE_BLOCK_9]
Here's an example of using
[CODE_BLOCK_10]
pages/index.js
[CODE_BLOCK_11]
We provide a codemod (a code to code transformation) to automatically change the
[CODE_BLOCK_13]
property usages to
[CODE_BLOCK_14]
You can find this codemod and instructions on how to run it here:
