HTML
element represents
metadata
that cannot be represented by other meta-related elements, such as

Content-Security-Policy

Content-Type

The type of metadata provided by the
--- CODE BLOCK 40 ---
default-style
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
element can be one of the following:
If the
--- CODE BLOCK 41 ---
x-ua-compatible
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
attribute is set, the
--- CODE BLOCK 57 ---
theme-color
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
element provides
document-level metadata
that applies to the whole page.
If the
--- CODE BLOCK 64 ---
description
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
attribute is set, the
--- CODE BLOCK 65 ---
<meta
name="description"
content="The HTML reference describes all elements and attributes of HTML, including global attributes that apply to all elements." />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
element acts as a
pragma directive
to simulate directives that could otherwise be given by an HTTP header.
If the
--- CODE BLOCK 66 ---
<meta
name="description"
content="The HTML reference describes all elements and attributes of HTML, including global attributes that apply to all elements." />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
attribute is set, the
--- CODE BLOCK 67 ---
http-equiv="refresh"
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
element is a
charset declaration
, giving the character encoding in which the document is encoded.
If the
--- CODE BLOCK 68 ---
content="3;url=https://www.mozilla.org"
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
attribute is set, the
--- CODE BLOCK 69 ---
https://www.mozilla.org
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
element provides
user-defined metadata
Attributes
This element includes the
global attributes
Note:
--- CODE BLOCK 70 ---
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="3;url=https://www.mozilla.org" />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
attribute has a specific meaning for the
--- CODE BLOCK 71 ---
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="3;url=https://www.mozilla.org" />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
element. The
--- CODE BLOCK 73 ---
<meta charset>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
attribute must not be set on a

--- END CODE BLOCK ---
element that includes a

attribute.
[CODE_BLOCK_23]
This attribute declares the document's character encoding. If the attribute is present, its value must be an ASCII case-insensitive match for the string
[CODE_BLOCK_24]
, because UTF-8 is the only valid encoding for HTML5 documents.
[CODE_BLOCK_25]
elements which declare a character encoding must be located entirely within the first 1024 bytes of the document.
[CODE_BLOCK_26]
This attribute contains the value for the
[CODE_BLOCK_27]
[CODE_BLOCK_28]
attribute, depending on which is used.
[CODE_BLOCK_29]
Defines a pragma directive. The attribute's name, short for
[CODE_BLOCK_30]
, is because all the allowed values are names of particular HTTP headers:
[CODE_BLOCK_31]
Allows page authors to define a
content policy
for the current page. Content policies mostly specify allowed server origins and script endpoints which help guard against cross-site scripting attacks.
[CODE_BLOCK_32]
for more information.
[CODE_BLOCK_33]
Declares the
MIME type
and the document's character encoding. The
[CODE_BLOCK_34]
attribute must have the value
[CODE_BLOCK_35]
if specified. This is equivalent to a
[CODE_BLOCK_36]
element with the
[CODE_BLOCK_37]
attribute specified and carries the same restriction on placement within the document.
Note:
Can only be used in documents served with a
[CODE_BLOCK_38]
â€” not in documents served with an XML MIME type.
Also see
[CODE_BLOCK_39]
[CODE_BLOCK_40]
Sets the name of the default
CSS style sheet
set.
[CODE_BLOCK_41]
If specified, the
[CODE_BLOCK_42]
attribute must have the value
[CODE_BLOCK_43]
. User agents are required to ignore this pragma.
[CODE_BLOCK_44]
This instruction specifies:
The number of seconds until the page should be reloaded - if the
[CODE_BLOCK_45]
attribute's value is a non-negative integer.
The number of seconds until the page should redirect to another - if the
[CODE_BLOCK_46]
attribute's value is a non-negative integer followed by
[CODE_BLOCK_47]
and a valid URL.
The timer starts when the page is
completely loaded
, which is after the
[CODE_BLOCK_48]
[CODE_BLOCK_49]
events have both fired.

[CODE_BLOCK_50]
Warning:
Pages set with a
[CODE_BLOCK_51]
value run the risk of having the time interval being too short. People navigating with the aid of assistive technology such as a screen reader may be unable to read through and understand the page's content before being automatically redirected. The abrupt, unannounced updating of the page content may also be disorienting for people experiencing low vision conditions.

[CODE_BLOCK_52]
[CODE_BLOCK_53]
attribute defines which media the theme color defined in the
[CODE_BLOCK_54]
attribute should be applied to. Its value is a
media query
, which defaults to
[CODE_BLOCK_55]
if the attribute is missing. This attribute is only relevant when the element's
[CODE_BLOCK_56]
attribute is set to
[CODE_BLOCK_57]
. Otherwise, it has no effect, and should not be included.
[CODE_BLOCK_58]
[CODE_BLOCK_59]
[CODE_BLOCK_60]
attributes can be used together to provide document metadata in terms of name-value pairs, with the
[CODE_BLOCK_61]
attribute giving the metadata name, and the
[CODE_BLOCK_62]
attribute giving the value.
Examples
Setting a meta description
The following
[CODE_BLOCK_63]
tag provides a
[CODE_BLOCK_64]
as metadata for the web page:
html
Copy to Clipboard
[CODE_BLOCK_65]
Setting a page redirect
The following example uses
[CODE_BLOCK_67]
to direct the browser to perform a redirect.
[CODE_BLOCK_68]
attribute will redirect page to
[CODE_BLOCK_69]
after 3 seconds:
html
Copy to Clipboard
