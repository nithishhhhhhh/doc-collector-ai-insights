Time to First Byte
(TTFB) refers to the time between the browser requesting a page and when it receives the first byte of information from the server. This time includes
lookup and establishing the connection using a
handshake and
handshake if the request is made over
HTTPS
TTFB is the time it takes between the start of the request and the start of the response, in milliseconds. This can be measured using the
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
responseStart
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
attribute of
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
PerformanceNavigationTiming
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Copy to Clipboard
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
const ttfb = performance.getEntriesByType("navigation")[0].responseStart;
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Note:
For sites using
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
103 Early Hints
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, TTFB is typically the
first bytes
(after any redirects) â€” and so, the 103 interim response. Site owners wishing to measure the time until the final response should use
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
finalResponseHeadersStart
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, where supported.
