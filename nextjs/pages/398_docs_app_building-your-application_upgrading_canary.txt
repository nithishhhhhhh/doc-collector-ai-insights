Node.js server
Next.js can be deployed to any provider that supports Node.js. Ensure your

has the

npm run build

Then, run

to build your application and
[CODE_BLOCK_7]
to start the Node.js server. This server supports all Next.js features. If needed, you can also eject to a
custom server
Node.js deployments support all Next.js features. Learn how to
configure them
for your infrastructure.

Docker
Next.js can be deployed to any provider that supports
Docker
containers. This includes container orchestrators like Kubernetes or a cloud provider that runs Docker.
Docker deployments support all Next.js features. Learn how to
configure them
for your infrastructure.
Note for development:
While Docker is excellent for production deployments, consider using local development (
[CODE_BLOCK_8]
) instead of Docker during development on Mac and Windows for better performance.

Static export
Next.js enables starting as a static site or
Single-Page Application (SPA)
, then later optionally upgrading to use features that require a server.
Since Next.js supports
static exports
, it can be deployed and hosted on any web server that can serve HTML/CSS/JS static assets. This includes tools like AWS S3, Nginx, or Apache.
Running as a
static export
does not
support Next.js features that require a server.

Adapters
Next.js can be adapted to run on different platforms to support their infrastructure capabilities.
Refer to each provider's documentation for information on supported Next.js features:
AWS Amplify Hosting
Cloudflare
Deno Deploy
Netlify
Vercel
Note:
We are working on a
Deployment Adapters API
for all platforms to adopt. After completion, we will add documentation on how to write your own adapters.
