AMP support is one of our advanced features, you can

To enable AMP, add the following config to your page:
pages/index.js
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
export const config = { amp: true }
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
export const config = { amp: true }
function About(props) {
return <h3>My AMP About Page!</h3>
export default About
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
config accepts the following values:
--- CODE BLOCK 8 ---
export const config = { amp: true }
function About(props) {
return <h3>My AMP About Page!</h3>
export default About
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
- The page will be AMP-only
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
import { useAmp } from 'next/amp'
export const config = { amp: 'hybrid' }
function About(props) {
const isAmp = useAmp()
return (
<div>
<h3>My AMP About Page!</h3>
{isAmp ? (
<amp-img
width="300"
height="300"
src="/my-img.jpg"
alt="a cool image"
layout="responsive"
) : (
<img width="300" height="300" src="/my-img.jpg" alt="a cool image" />
</div>
export default About

config, read the sections below.
AMP First Page
Take a look at the following example:
pages/about.js
[CODE_BLOCK_7]
The page above is an AMP-only page, which means:
The page has no Next.js or React client-side runtime
The page is automatically optimized with
AMP Optimizer
, an optimizer that applies the same transformations as AMP caches (improves performance by up to 42%)
The page has a user-accessible (optimized) version of the page and a search-engine indexable (unoptimized) version of the page
Hybrid AMP Page
Take a look at the following example:
pages/about.js
[CODE_BLOCK_9]
The page above is a hybrid AMP page, which means:
The page is rendered as traditional HTML (default) and AMP HTML (by adding
[CODE_BLOCK_11]
to the URL)
The AMP version of the page only has valid optimizations applied with AMP Optimizer so that it is indexable by search-engines
The page uses
[CODE_BLOCK_12]
to differentiate between modes, it's a
React Hook
that returns
[CODE_BLOCK_13]
if the page is using AMP, and
[CODE_BLOCK_14]
otherwise.
