allowedDevOrigins
Next.js does not automatically block cross-origin requests during development, but will block by default in a future major version of Next.js to prevent unauthorized requesting of internal assets/endpoints that are available in development mode.
To configure a Next.js application to allow requests from origins other than the hostname the server was initialized with (
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
allowedDevOrigins
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
by default) you can use the
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
allowedDevOrigins
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
config option.
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
local-origin.dev
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
allows you to set additional origins that can be used in development mode. For example, to use
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
next.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
instead of only
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
allowedDevOrigins
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, open
--- CODE BLOCK 8 ---
module.exports = {
allowedDevOrigins: ['local-origin.dev', '*.local-origin.dev'],
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
and add the
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
module.exports = {
allowedDevOrigins: ['local-origin.dev', '*.local-origin.dev'],
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
config:
next.config.js
