First Contentful Paint
(FCP) is when the browser renders the first content from the DOM, providing feedback to the user that the page is loading. Completing the first contentful paint answers the question "Is it happening?"
The First Contentful Paint
timestamp is when the browser first rendered any text, image (including background images), video, canvas that had been drawn into, or non-empty SVG. This excludes any content of iframes, but includes text with pending webfonts. This is the first time users could start consuming page content.
