property. Each side of the rectangle represented
[CODE_BLOCK_4]
is added to the corresponding side in the
[CODE_BLOCK_5]
element's
bounding box
before the intersection test is performed. This lets you, for example, adjust the bounds
outward so that the target element is considered 100% visible even if a certain number
of pixels worth of width or height is clipped away, or treat the target as partially
hidden if an edge is too close to the edge of the root's bounding box.

for a more in-depth look at the root margin and how it works with
the root's bounding box.
Value
A string, formatted similarly to the CSS
[CODE_BLOCK_6]
property's value, which
contains offsets for one or more sides of the root's bounding box. These offsets are
added to the corresponding values in the root's bounding box before the intersection
between the resulting rectangle and the target element's bounds.
The string returned by this property may not match the one specified when the
[CODE_BLOCK_7]
was instantiated. The browser is permitted to alter
the values
[CODE_BLOCK_8]
isn't specified when the object was instantiated, it
defaults to the string
[CODE_BLOCK_9]
, meaning that the intersection
will be computed between the root element's unmodified bounds rectangle and the target's
bounds.

describes how the
[CODE_BLOCK_10]
is used in more detail.
