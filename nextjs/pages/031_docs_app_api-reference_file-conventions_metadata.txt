Metadata Files API Reference
This section of the docs covers
Metadata file conventions
. File-based metadata can be defined by adding special metadata files to route segments.
Each file convention can be defined using a static file (e.g.
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
opengraph-image.jpg
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
), or a dynamic variant that uses code to generate the file (e.g.
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
opengraph-image.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Once a file is defined, Next.js will automatically serve the file (with hashes in production for caching) and update the relevant head elements with the correct metadata, such as the asset's URL, file type, and image size.
Good to know
Special Route Handlers like
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
opengraph-image.tsx
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
middleware.ts
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, and
[CODE_BLOCK_5]
, and other
metadata files
are cached by default.
If using along with
[CODE_BLOCK_6]
configure the matcher
to exclude the metadata files.
