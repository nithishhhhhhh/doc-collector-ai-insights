--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
SubtleCrypto
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
read-only property of the
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
getRandomValues()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
interface returns the
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
getRandomValues()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
object for this window's scope. This object gives web pages access to certain cryptographic related services.
Although the property itself is read-only, all of its methods (and the methods of its
child object,
--- CODE BLOCK 11 ---
globalThis.genRandomNumbers = () => {
const array = new Uint32Array(10);
globalThis.crypto.getRandomValues(array);
const randText = document.getElementById("myRandText");
randText.textContent = `The random numbers are: ${array.join(" ")}`;
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
) are not read-only, and therefore vulnerable
to attack by
polyfill
Although
--- CODE BLOCK 12 ---
globalThis.genRandomNumbers = () => {
const array = new Uint32Array(10);
globalThis.crypto.getRandomValues(array);
const randText = document.getElementById("myRandText");
randText.textContent = `The random numbers are: ${array.join(" ")}`;
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
is available on all windows, the returned
--- CODE BLOCK 13 ---
<p id="myRandText">The random numbers are:</p>
<button type="button" onClick="genRandomNumbers()">
Generate 10 random numbers
</button>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
object only has one usable feature in insecure contexts: the
--- CODE BLOCK 14 ---
<p id="myRandText">The random numbers are:</p>
<button type="button" onClick="genRandomNumbers()">
Generate 10 random numbers
</button>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
method. In general, you should use this API only in secure contexts.
Value
An instance of the
--- CODE BLOCK 16 ---
WorkerGlobalScope.crypto
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
interface, providing access to general-purpose cryptography and a strong random-number generator.
Examples
This example uses the
[CODE_BLOCK_9]
property to access the
