API Reference
Configuration
next.config.js
next.config.js
Next.js can be configured through a
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
next.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
file in the root of your project directory (for example, by
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
package.json
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
) with a default export.
next.config.js
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
// @ts-check
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
/* config options here */
module.exports = nextConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
ECMAScript Modules
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
next.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
is a regular Node.js module, not a JSON file. It gets used by the Next.js server and build phases, and it's not included in the browser build.
If you need
ECMAScript modules
, you can use
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
next.config.mjs
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
next.config.mjs
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
// @ts-check
* @type {import('next').NextConfig}
const nextConfig = {
/* config options here */
export default nextConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Good to know
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
next.config
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
with the
--- CODE BLOCK 13 ---
// @ts-check
export default (phase, { defaultConfig }) => {
* @type {import('next').NextConfig}
const nextConfig = {
/* config options here */
return nextConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 14 ---
// @ts-check
export default (phase, { defaultConfig }) => {
* @type {import('next').NextConfig}
const nextConfig = {
/* config options here */
return nextConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, or
--- CODE BLOCK 15 ---
// @ts-check
module.exports = async (phase, { defaultConfig }) => {
* @type {import('next').NextConfig}
const nextConfig = {
/* config options here */
return nextConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
extensions are currently
supported.
Configuration as a Function
You can also use a function:
next.config.mjs
--- CODE BLOCK 16 ---
// @ts-check
module.exports = async (phase, { defaultConfig }) => {
* @type {import('next').NextConfig}
const nextConfig = {
/* config options here */
return nextConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Async Configuration
Since Next.js 12.1.0, you can use an async function:
next.config.js
--- CODE BLOCK 19 ---
// @ts-check
const { PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER } = require('next/constants')
module.exports = (phase, { defaultConfig }) => {
if (phase === PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER) {
return {
/* development only config options here */
return {
/* config options for all phases except development here */
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Phase
--- CODE BLOCK 21 ---
next.config.ts
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
is the current context in which the configuration is loaded. You can see the
available phases
. Phases can be imported from
--- CODE BLOCK 22 ---
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
/* config options here */
export default nextConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
next.config.js
--- CODE BLOCK 23 ---
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
/* config options here */
export default nextConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
TypeScript
If you are using TypeScript in your project, you can use
--- CODE BLOCK 25 ---
next.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
to use TypeScript in your configuration:
next.config.ts
--- CODE BLOCK 26 ---
next/experimental/testing/server
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
The commented lines are the place where you can put the configs allowed by
--- CODE BLOCK 28 ---
unstable_getResponseFromNextConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, which are
defined in this file
However, none of the configs are required, and it's not necessary to understand what each config does. Instead, search for the features you need to enable or modify in this section and they will show you what to do.
Avoid using new JavaScript features not available in your target Node.js version.
--- CODE BLOCK 32 ---
next.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
will not be parsed by Webpack or Babel.
This page documents all the available configuration options:
Unit Testing (experimental)
Starting in Next.js 15.1, the
--- CODE BLOCK 33 ---
NextResponse
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
package contains utilities to help unit test
--- CODE BLOCK 34 ---
unstable_getResponseFromNextConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
files.
--- CODE BLOCK 35 ---
next.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
function runs the
--- CODE BLOCK 36 ---
import {
getRedirectUrl,
unstable_getResponseFromNextConfig,
} from 'next/experimental/testing/server'
const response = await unstable_getResponseFromNextConfig({
url: 'https://nextjs.org/test',
nextConfig: {
async redirects() {
return [{ source: '/test', destination: '/test2', permanent: false }]
expect(response.status).toEqual(307)
expect(getRedirectUrl(response)).toEqual('https://nextjs.org/test2')
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 37 ---
import {
getRedirectUrl,
unstable_getResponseFromNextConfig,
} from 'next/experimental/testing/server'
const response = await unstable_getResponseFromNextConfig({
url: 'https://nextjs.org/test',
nextConfig: {
async redirects() {
return [{ source: '/test', destination: '/test2', permanent: false }]
expect(response.status).toEqual(307)
expect(getRedirectUrl(response)).toEqual('https://nextjs.org/test2')
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, and
[CODE_BLOCK_31]
functions from
[CODE_BLOCK_32]
with the provided request information and returns
[CODE_BLOCK_33]
with the results of the routing.
The response from
[CODE_BLOCK_34]
only considers
[CODE_BLOCK_35]
fields and does not consider middleware or filesystem routes, so the result in production may be different than the unit test.
