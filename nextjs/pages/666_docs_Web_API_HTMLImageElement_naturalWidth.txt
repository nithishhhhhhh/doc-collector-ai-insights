--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
HTMLImageElement
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
interface's read-only
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
naturalWidth
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
property returns the intrinsic (natural),
density-corrected width of the image in
CSS pixels
This is the width the image is if drawn with nothing constraining
its width; if you neither specify a width for the image nor place the image inside a
container that limits or expressly specifies the image width, this is the number of CSS
pixels wide the image will be.
The corresponding
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
naturalHeight
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
method
returns the natural height of the image.
Note:
Most of the time the natural width is the actual width of the image sent by the server.
Nevertheless, browsers can modify an image before pushing it to the renderer. For example, Chrome
degrades the resolution of images on low-end devices
. In such cases,
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
naturalWidth
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
will consider the width of the image modified
by such browser interventions as the natural width, and returns this value.
Value
An integer value indicating the intrinsic width of the image, in CSS pixels. This is
the width at which the image is naturally drawn when no constraint or specific value is
established for the image. This natural width is corrected for the pixel density of the
device on which it's being presented, unlike the value of
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
naturalWidth
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
If the intrinsic width is not availableâ€”either because the image does not specify an
intrinsic width or because the image data is not available in order to obtain this
information,
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
HTMLImageElement.naturalHeight
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
returns 0.
Examples
[CODE_BLOCK_7]
for example code that displays an image in both its natural "density-adjusted" size, and in its rendered size as altered by the page's CSS and other factors.
