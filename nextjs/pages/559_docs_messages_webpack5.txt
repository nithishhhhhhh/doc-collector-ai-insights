Webpack 5 Adoption
Webpack 5 Adoption
Why This Message Occurred
Next.js has adopted webpack 5 as the default for compilation. We've spent a lot of effort into ensuring the transition from webpack 4 to 5 will be as smooth as possible.
Your application currently has webpack 5 disabled using the
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
webpack5: false
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
flag which has been removed in Next.js 12:
next.config.js
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
module.exports = {
// Webpack 5 is enabled by default
// You can still use webpack 4 while upgrading to the latest version of Next.js by adding the "webpack5: false" flag
webpack5: false,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Using webpack 5 in your application has many benefits, notably:
Improved Disk Caching:
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
new URL("file.png", import.meta.url)
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
is significantly faster on subsequent builds
Improved Fast Refresh: Fast Refresh work is prioritized
Improved Long Term Caching of Assets: Deterministic code output that is less likely to change between builds
Improved Tree Shaking
Support for assets using
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
new Worker(new URL("worker.js", import.meta.url))
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Support for web workers using
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
package.json
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Support for
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
next.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 11 ---
next.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
field in
--- CODE BLOCK 12 ---
webpack5: false
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
In the past releases we have gradually rolled out webpack 5 to Next.js applications:
In Next.js 10.2 we automatically opted-in applications without custom webpack configuration in
--- CODE BLOCK 13 ---
next.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
In Next.js 10.2 we automatically opted-in applications that do not have a
--- CODE BLOCK 14 ---
next-transpile-modules
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
In Next.js 11 webpack 5 was enabled by default for all applications. You could still opt-out and use webpack 4 to help with backwards compatibility using
--- CODE BLOCK 15 ---
@zeit/next-css
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 16 ---
@zeit/next-sass
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
In Next.js 12 webpack 4 support was removed.
Custom webpack configuration
In case you do have custom webpack configuration, either through custom plugins or your own modifications you'll have to take a few steps to ensure your applications works with webpack 5.
When using
--- CODE BLOCK 17 ---
@zeit/next-preact
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
make sure you use the latest version which includes
this patch
When using
--- CODE BLOCK 18 ---
@zeit/next-source-maps
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
[CODE_BLOCK_16]
make sure you use the
built-in CSS/Sass support
instead
When using
[CODE_BLOCK_17]
this example
instead
When using
[CODE_BLOCK_18]
use the
built-in production Source Map support
When using webpack plugins make sure they're upgraded to the latest version, in most cases the latest version will include webpack 5 support. In some cases these upgraded webpack plugins will only support webpack 5.
