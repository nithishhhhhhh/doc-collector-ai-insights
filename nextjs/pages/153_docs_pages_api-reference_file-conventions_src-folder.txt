src Directory
As an alternative to having the special Next.js
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
package.json
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 11 ---
next.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
directories in the root of your project, Next.js also supports the common pattern of placing application code under the
--- CODE BLOCK 12 ---
tsconfig.json
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
folder.
This separates application code from project configuration files which mostly live in the root of a project, which is preferred by some individuals and teams.
To use the
--- CODE BLOCK 19 ---
/components
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
folder, move the
--- CODE BLOCK 23 ---
tailwind.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Router folder or
--- CODE BLOCK 26 ---
tsconfig.json
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Router folder to
[CODE_BLOCK_7]
[CODE_BLOCK_8]
respectively.
Good to know
[CODE_BLOCK_9]
directory should remain in the root of your project.
Config files like
[CODE_BLOCK_10]
[CODE_BLOCK_11]
[CODE_BLOCK_12]
should remain in the root of your project.
[CODE_BLOCK_13]
files should remain in the root of your project.
[CODE_BLOCK_14]
[CODE_BLOCK_15]
will be ignored if
[CODE_BLOCK_16]
[CODE_BLOCK_17]
are present in the root directory.
If you're using
[CODE_BLOCK_18]
, you'll probably also move other application folders such as
[CODE_BLOCK_19]
[CODE_BLOCK_20]
If you're using Middleware, ensure it is placed inside the
[CODE_BLOCK_21]
folder.
If you're using Tailwind CSS, you'll need to add the
[CODE_BLOCK_22]
prefix to the
[CODE_BLOCK_23]
file in the
content section
If you are using TypeScript paths for imports such as
[CODE_BLOCK_24]
, you should update the
[CODE_BLOCK_25]
object in
[CODE_BLOCK_26]
to include
[CODE_BLOCK_27]
