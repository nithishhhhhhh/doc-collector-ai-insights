basePath
To deploy a Next.js application under a sub-path of a domain you can use the
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
next.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
config option.
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
module.exports = {
basePath: '/docs',
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
allows you to set a path prefix for the application. For example, to use
--- CODE BLOCK 8 ---
module.exports = {
basePath: '/docs',
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
instead of
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
next/router
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
(an empty string, the default), open
--- CODE BLOCK 13 ---
/docs/about
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
and add the
--- CODE BLOCK 16 ---
export default function HomePage() {
return (
<Link href="/about">About Page</Link>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
config:
next.config.js
--- CODE BLOCK 17 ---
export default function HomePage() {
return (
<Link href="/about">About Page</Link>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Good to know
: This value must be set at build time and cannot be changed without re-building as the value is inlined in the client-side bundles.
Links
When linking to other pages using
--- CODE BLOCK 19 ---
<a href="/docs/about">About Page</a>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 24 ---
/docs/me.png
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 27 ---
import Image from 'next/image'
function Home() {
return (
<h1>My Homepage</h1>
<Image
src="/docs/me.png"
alt="Picture of the author"
width={500}
height={500}
<p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>
export default Home
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
will be automatically applied.
For example, using
--- CODE BLOCK 28 ---
import Image from 'next/image'
function Home() {
return (
<h1>My Homepage</h1>
<Image
src="/docs/me.png"
alt="Picture of the author"
width={500}
height={500}
<p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>
export default Home
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
will automatically become
[CODE_BLOCK_13]
when
[CODE_BLOCK_14]
is set to
[CODE_BLOCK_15]
[CODE_BLOCK_16]
Output html:
[CODE_BLOCK_18]
This makes sure that you don't have to change all links in your application when changing the
[CODE_BLOCK_20]
value.
Images
When using the
[CODE_BLOCK_21]
component, you will need to add the
[CODE_BLOCK_22]
in front of
[CODE_BLOCK_23]
For example, using
[CODE_BLOCK_24]
will properly serve your image when
[CODE_BLOCK_25]
is set to
[CODE_BLOCK_26]
[CODE_BLOCK_27]
