SubtleCrypto

interface of the
Web Crypto API
provides a number of low-level cryptographic functions.
The interface name includes the term "subtle" to indicate that many of its algorithms have subtle usage requirements, and hence that it must be used carefully in order to provide suitable security guarantees.
An instance of

--- END CODE BLOCK ---
is available as the
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
Window.crypto
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
property of the
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
WorkerGlobalScope.crypto
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
interface, which in turn is available in windows through the
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
SubtleCrypto.encrypt()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
property and in workers through the
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
SubtleCrypto.decrypt()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
property.
Warning:
This API provides a number of low-level cryptographic primitives. It's very easy to misuse them, and the pitfalls involved can be very subtle.
Even assuming you use the basic cryptographic functions correctly, secure key management and overall security system design are extremely hard to get right, and are generally the domain of specialist security experts.
Errors in security system design and implementation can make the security of the system completely ineffective.
Please learn and experiment, but don't guarantee or imply the security of your work before an individual knowledgeable in this subject matter thoroughly reviews it. The
Crypto 101 Course
can be a great place to start learning about the design and implementation of secure systems.

Using SubtleCrypto
We can split the functions implemented by this API into two groups: cryptography functions and key management functions.
Cryptography functions
These are the functions you can use to implement security features such as privacy and authentication in a system. The
[CODE_BLOCK_36]
API provides the following cryptography functions:
[CODE_BLOCK_37]
[CODE_BLOCK_38]
: create and verify digital signatures.
[CODE_BLOCK_39]
[CODE_BLOCK_40]
: encrypt and decrypt data.
[CODE_BLOCK_41]
: create a fixed-length, collision-resistant digest of some data.
Key management functions
Except for
[CODE_BLOCK_42]
, all the cryptography functions in the API use cryptographic keys. In the
[CODE_BLOCK_43]
API a cryptographic key is represented using a
[CODE_BLOCK_44]
object. To perform operations like signing and encrypting, you pass a
[CODE_BLOCK_45]
object into the
[CODE_BLOCK_46]
[CODE_BLOCK_47]
function.
Generating and deriving keys
[CODE_BLOCK_48]
[CODE_BLOCK_49]
functions both create a new
[CODE_BLOCK_50]
object.
The difference is that
[CODE_BLOCK_51]
will generate a new distinct key value each time you call it, while
[CODE_BLOCK_52]
derives a key from some initial keying material. If you provide the same keying material to two separate calls to
[CODE_BLOCK_53]
, you will get two
[CODE_BLOCK_54]
objects that have the same underlying value. This is useful if, for example, you want to derive an encryption key from a password and later derive the same key from the same password to decrypt the data.
Importing and exporting keys
To make keys available outside your app, you need to export the key, and that's what
[CODE_BLOCK_55]
is for. You can choose one of a number of export formats.
The inverse of
[CODE_BLOCK_56]
[CODE_BLOCK_57]
. You can import keys from other systems, and support for standard formats like
PKCS #8
JSON Web Key
helps you do this. The
[CODE_BLOCK_58]
function exports the key in an unencrypted format.
If the key is sensitive you should use
[CODE_BLOCK_59]
, which exports the key and then encrypts it using another key; the API calls a "key-wrapping key".
The inverse of
[CODE_BLOCK_60]
[CODE_BLOCK_61]
, which decrypts then imports the key.
Storing keys
[CODE_BLOCK_62]
is a
serializable object
, which allows keys to be stored and retrieved using standard web storage APIs.
The specification expects that most developers will use the
IndexedDB API
, storing
[CODE_BLOCK_63]
objects against some key string identifier that is meaningful to the application, along with any other metadata it finds useful.
This allows the storage and retrieval of the
[CODE_BLOCK_64]
without having to expose its underlying key material to the application or the JavaScript environment.
Supported algorithms
The cryptographic functions provided by the Web Crypto API can be performed by one or more different
cryptographic algorithms
: the
[CODE_BLOCK_65]
argument to the function indicates which algorithm to use. Some algorithms need extra parameters: in these cases the
[CODE_BLOCK_66]
argument is a dictionary object that includes the extra parameters.
