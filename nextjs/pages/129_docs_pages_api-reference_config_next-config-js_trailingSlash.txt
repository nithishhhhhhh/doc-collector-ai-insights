You are currently viewing the documentation for Pages Router.
trailingSlash
By default Next.js will redirect URLs with trailing slashes to their counterpart without a trailing slash. For example
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
next.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
will redirect to
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
trailingSlash
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
. You can configure this behavior to act the opposite way, where URLs without trailing slashes are redirected to their counterparts with trailing slashes.
Open
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
module.exports = {
trailingSlash: true,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
and add the
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
module.exports = {
trailingSlash: true,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
config:
next.config.js
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
trailingSlash: true
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
With this option set, URLs like
--- CODE BLOCK 12 ---
images/photos/picture.png
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
will redirect to
--- CODE BLOCK 13 ---
.well-known/subfolder/config.json
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
When using
--- CODE BLOCK 14 ---
output: "export"
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, certain URLs are exceptions and will not have a trailing slash appended:
Static file URLs, such as files with extensions.
Any paths under
--- CODE BLOCK 16 ---
/about/index.html
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
For example, the following URLs will remain unchanged:
--- CODE BLOCK 17 ---
/about.html
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 19 ---
trailingSlash
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, and
[CODE_BLOCK_13]
When used with
[CODE_BLOCK_14]
configuration, the
[CODE_BLOCK_15]
page will output
[CODE_BLOCK_16]
(instead of the default
[CODE_BLOCK_17]
