How to set up Vitest with Next.js
Vite and React Testing Library are frequently used together for
Unit Testing
. This guide will show you how to setup Vitest with Next.js and write your first tests.
Good to know:
Since
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
create-next-app
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Server Components are new to the React ecosystem, Vitest currently does not support them. While you can still run
unit tests
for synchronous Server and Client Components, we recommend using
E2E tests
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
npx create-next-app@latest --example with-vitest with-vitest-app
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
components.
Quickstart
You can use
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
npx create-next-app@latest --example with-vitest with-vitest-app
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
with the Next.js
with-vitest
example to quickly get started:
Terminal
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
# Using TypeScript
npm install -D vitest @vitejs/plugin-react jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom vite-tsconfig-paths
# Using JavaScript
npm install -D vitest @vitejs/plugin-react jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Manual Setup
To manually set up Vitest, install
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
vitest.config.mts|js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
and the following packages as dev dependencies:
Terminal
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'
export default defineConfig({
plugins: [tsconfigPaths(), react()],
test: {
environment: 'jsdom',
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Create a
--- CODE BLOCK 13 ---
package.json
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
file in the root of your project, and add the following options:
vitest.config.mts
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
--- CODE BLOCK 14 ---
"scripts": {
"dev": "next dev",
"build": "next build",
"start": "next start",
"test": "vitest"
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
For more information on configuring Vitest, please refer to the
Vitest Configuration
docs.
Then, add a
--- CODE BLOCK 16 ---
npm run test
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
script to your
--- CODE BLOCK 18 ---
import Link from 'next/link'
export default function Page() {
return (
<div>
<h1>Home</h1>
<Link href="/about">About</Link>
</div>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
package.json
--- CODE BLOCK 19 ---
import Link from 'next/link'
export default function Page() {
return (
<div>
<h1>Home</h1>
<Link href="/about">About</Link>
</div>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
When you run
--- CODE BLOCK 21 ---
import { expect, test } from 'vitest'
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import Page from '../app/page'
test('Page', () => {
render(<Page />)
expect(screen.getByRole('heading', { level: 1, name: 'Home' })).toBeDefined()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, Vitest will
watch
for changes in your project by default.
Creating your first Vitest Unit Test
Check that everything is working by creating a test to check if the
--- CODE BLOCK 24 ---
npm run test
# or
yarn test
# or
pnpm test
# or
bun test
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
component successfully renders a heading:
app/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
--- CODE BLOCK 25 ---
npm run test
# or
yarn test
# or
pnpm test
# or
bun test
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
__tests__/page.test.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_20]
Good to know
: The example above uses the common
[CODE_BLOCK_22]
convention, but test files can also be colocated inside the
[CODE_BLOCK_23]
router.
Running your tests
Then, run the following command to run your tests:
Terminal
[CODE_BLOCK_24]
