Examples
Data Fetching
By default,
[CODE_BLOCK_10]
is a Server Component. You can mark it as
[CODE_BLOCK_11]
to fetch and display data:
app/not-found.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_12]
If you need to use Client Component hooks like
[CODE_BLOCK_14]
to display content based on the path, you must fetch data on the client-side instead.
