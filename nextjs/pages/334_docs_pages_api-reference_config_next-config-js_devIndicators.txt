Troubleshooting
Indicator not marking a route as static
If you expect a route to be static and the indicator has marked it as dynamic, it's likely the route has opted out of static rendering.
You can confirm if a route is
static
dynamic
by building your application using
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
Route (app)                              Size     First Load JS
┌ ○ /_not-found                          0 B               0 kB
└ ƒ /products/[id]                       0 B               0 kB
○  (Static)   prerendered as static content
ƒ  (Dynamic)  server-rendered on demand
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, and checking the output in your terminal. Static (or prerendered) routes will display a
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
Route (app)                              Size     First Load JS
┌ ○ /_not-found                          0 B               0 kB
└ ƒ /products/[id]                       0 B               0 kB
○  (Static)   prerendered as static content
ƒ  (Dynamic)  server-rendered on demand
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
symbol, whereas dynamic routes will display a
--- CODE BLOCK 11 ---
getServerSideProps
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
symbol. For example:
Build Output
--- CODE BLOCK 12 ---
getInitialProps
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
When exporting
--- CODE BLOCK 16 ---
buildActivity
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 17 ---
buildActivityPosition
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
from a page, it will be marked as dynamic.
