This feature is available in
Web Workers
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
DOMException
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
interface represents an abnormal event (called an
exception
) that occurs as a result of calling a method or accessing a property of a web API. This is how error conditions are described in web APIs.
Each exception has a
name
, which is a short "PascalCase"-style string identifying the error or abnormal condition.
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
DOMException
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
is a
Serializable object
, so it can be cloned with
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
structuredClone()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
or copied between
Workers
using
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
postMessage()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Constructor
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
DOMException()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Returns a
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
DOMException
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
object with a specified message and name.

--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
DOMException.code
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Deprecated
Read only
Returns one of the legacy error code constants, or
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
DOMException.message
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
if none match.
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
DOMException.name
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Read only
Returns a string representing a message or description associated with the given
error name
--- CODE BLOCK 12 ---
DOMSTRING_SIZE_ERR
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Read only
Returns a string that contains one of the strings associated with an
error name
Error names
Common error names are listed here. Some APIs define their own sets of names, so this is not necessarily a complete list.
Note that the following deprecated historical errors don't have an error name but instead have only a legacy constant code value and a legacy constant name:
Legacy code value:
--- CODE BLOCK 14 ---
NO_DATA_ALLOWED_ERR
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, legacy constant name:
--- CODE BLOCK 16 ---
VALIDATION_ERR
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Legacy code value:
--- CODE BLOCK 17 ---
IndexSizeError
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, legacy constant name:
--- CODE BLOCK 20 ---
INDEX_SIZE_ERR
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Legacy code value:
--- CODE BLOCK 21 ---
HierarchyRequestError
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, legacy constant name:
--- CODE BLOCK 23 ---
HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Note:
Because historically the errors were identified by a numeric value that corresponded with a named variable defined to have that value, some of the entries below indicate the legacy code value and constant name that were used in the past.
--- CODE BLOCK 24 ---
