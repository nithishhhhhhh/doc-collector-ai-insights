Since the release of
Next.js 9.4
we now have a more intuitive and ergonomic experience for
adding environment variables
. Give it a try!
Good to know
: environment variables specified in this way will
always
be included in the JavaScript bundle, prefixing the environment variable name with
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
NEXT_PUBLIC_
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
only has an effect when specifying them
through the environment or .env files
To add environment variables to the JavaScript bundle, open
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
next.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
and add the
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
module.exports = {
env: {
customKey: 'my-value',
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
config:
next.config.js
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
module.exports = {
env: {
customKey: 'my-value',
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Now you can access
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
function Page() {
return <h1>The value of customKey is: {process.env.customKey}</h1>
export default Page
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
in your code. For example:
--- CODE BLOCK 8 ---
function Page() {
return <h1>The value of customKey is: {process.env.customKey}</h1>
export default Page
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Next.js will replace
--- CODE BLOCK 11 ---
process.env
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
with
--- CODE BLOCK 12 ---
return <h1>The value of customKey is: {process.env.customKey}</h1>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
at build time. Trying to destructure
--- CODE BLOCK 13 ---
return <h1>The value of customKey is: {process.env.customKey}</h1>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
variables won't work due to the nature of webpack
DefinePlugin
For example, the following line:
--- CODE BLOCK 14 ---
return <h1>The value of customKey is: {'my-value'}</h1>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Will end up being:
[CODE_BLOCK_14]
