Trace semantic conventions
Status
Mixed
In OpenTelemetry spans can be created freely and itâ€™s up to the implementer to
annotate them with attributes specific to the represented operation. Spans
represent specific operations in and between systems. Some of these operations
represent calls that use well-known protocols like HTTP or database calls.
Depending on the protocol and the type of operation, additional information
is needed to represent and analyze a span correctly in monitoring systems. It is
also important to unify how this attribution is made in different languages.
This way, the operator will not need to learn specifics of a language and
telemetry collected from polyglot (multi-language) micro-service environments
can still be easily correlated and cross-analyzed.
The following semantic conventions for spans are defined:
General
: General semantic attributes that may be used in describing different kinds of operations.
Compatibility
: For spans generated by compatibility components, e.g. OpenTracing Shim layer.
CloudEvents
: Semantic Conventions for the CloudEvents spans.
Cloud Providers
: Semantic Conventions for cloud providers spans.
Database
: For SQL and NoSQL client call spans.
Exceptions
: For recording exceptions associated with a span.
FaaS
: For
Function as a Service
(e.g., AWS Lambda) spans.
HTTP
: For HTTP client and server spans.
Messaging
: For messaging systems (queues, publish/subscribe, etc.) spans.
Object Stores
: Semantic Conventions for object stores spans.
RPC/RMI
: For remote procedure call (e.g., gRPC) spans.
Apart from semantic conventions for traces,
metrics
logs
, and
events
OpenTelemetry also defines the concept of overarching
Resources
with their own
