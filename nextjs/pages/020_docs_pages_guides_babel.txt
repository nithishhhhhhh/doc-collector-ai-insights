How to configure Babel in Next.js
Examples
Customizing babel configuration
Next.js includes the
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
babel.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
preset to your app, which includes everything needed to compile React applications and server-side code. But if you want to extend the default Babel configs, it's also possible.
Adding Presets and Plugins
To start, you only need to define a
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
"presets": ["next/babel"],
"plugins": []
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
file (or
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
"presets": ["next/babel"],
"plugins": []
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
) in the root directory of your project. If such a file is found, it will be considered as the
source of truth
, and therefore it needs to define what Next.js needs as well, which is the
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
"presets": ["next/babel"],
"plugins": ["@babel/plugin-proposal-do-expressions"]
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
preset.
Here's an example
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
"presets": ["next/babel"],
"plugins": ["@babel/plugin-proposal-do-expressions"]
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
file:
.babelrc
--- CODE BLOCK 12 ---
"presets": [
"next/babel",
"preset-env": {},
"transform-runtime": {},
"styled-jsx": {},
"class-properties": {}
"plugins": []
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
You can
take a look at this file
to learn about the presets included by
--- CODE BLOCK 15 ---
"preset-env"
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
To add presets/plugins
without configuring them
, you can do it this way:
.babelrc
[CODE_BLOCK_9]
Customizing Presets and Plugins
To add presets/plugins
with custom configuration
, do it on the
[CODE_BLOCK_11]
preset like so:
.babelrc
[CODE_BLOCK_12]
To learn more about the available options for each config, visit babel's
documentation
site.
Good to know
Next.js uses the
current
Node.js version
for server-side compilations.
[CODE_BLOCK_14]
option on
[CODE_BLOCK_15]
should be kept to
[CODE_BLOCK_16]
, otherwise webpack code splitting is turned off.
