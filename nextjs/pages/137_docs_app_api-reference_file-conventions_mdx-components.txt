Params
[CODE_BLOCK_14]
When defining MDX Components, the export function accepts a single parameter,
[CODE_BLOCK_15]
. This parameter is an instance of
[CODE_BLOCK_16]
The key is the name of the HTML element to override.
The value is the component to render instead.
Good to know
: Remember to pass all other components (i.e.
[CODE_BLOCK_17]
) that do not have overrides.
