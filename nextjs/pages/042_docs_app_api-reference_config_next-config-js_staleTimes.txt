[CODE_BLOCK_5]
[CODE_BLOCK_6]
properties correspond with the time period (in seconds) based on different types of
link prefetching
[CODE_BLOCK_7]
property is used when the page is neither statically generated nor fully prefetched (e.g. with
[CODE_BLOCK_8]
Default: 0 seconds (not cached)
[CODE_BLOCK_9]
property is used for statically generated pages, or when the
