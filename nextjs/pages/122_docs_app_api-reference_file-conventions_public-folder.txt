public Folder
Next.js can serve static files, like images, under a folder called
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
public/avatars/me.png
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
in the root directory. Files inside
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
/avatars/me.png
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
import Image from 'next/image'
export function Avatar({ id, alt }) {
return <Image src={`/avatars/${id}.png`} alt={alt} width="64" height="64" />
export function AvatarOfMe() {
return <Avatar id="me" alt="A portrait of me" />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
For example, the file
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
import Image from 'next/image'
export function Avatar({ id, alt }) {
return <Image src={`/avatars/${id}.png`} alt={alt} width="64" height="64" />
export function AvatarOfMe() {
return <Avatar id="me" alt="A portrait of me" />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
can be viewed by visiting the
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
Cache-Control: public, max-age=0
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
path. The code to display that image might look like:
avatar.js
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
Cache-Control: public, max-age=0
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Caching
Next.js cannot safely cache assets in the
[CODE_BLOCK_8]
folder because they may change. The default caching headers applied are:
[CODE_BLOCK_9]
Robots, Favicons, and others
For static metadata files, such as
[CODE_BLOCK_11]
[CODE_BLOCK_12]
, etc, you should use
special metadata files
inside the
[CODE_BLOCK_13]
folder.
