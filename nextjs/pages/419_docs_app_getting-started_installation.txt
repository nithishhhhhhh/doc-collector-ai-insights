Installation
System requirements
Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:
Node.js 18.18
or later.
macOS, Windows (including WSL), or Linux.
Automatic installation
The quickest way to create a new Next.js app is using
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
create-next-app
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:
Terminal
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
npx create-next-app@latest
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
On installation, you'll see the following prompts:
Terminal
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`?  No / Yes
Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
After the prompts,
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
create-next-app
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.
Manual installation
To manually create a new Next.js app, install the required packages:
pnpm
yarn
Terminal
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
pnpm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Then, add the following scripts to your
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
package.json
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
file:
package.json
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
"scripts": {
"dev": "next dev",
"build": "next build",
"start": "next start",
"lint": "next lint"
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:
--- CODE BLOCK 22 ---
export default function RootLayout({
children,
}: {
children: React.ReactNode
}) {
return (
<html lang="en">
<body>{children}</body>
</html>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
: Starts the development server.
--- CODE BLOCK 23 ---
export default function RootLayout({
children,
}: {
children: React.ReactNode
}) {
return (
<html lang="en">
<body>{children}</body>
</html>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
: Builds the application for production.
--- CODE BLOCK 24 ---
app/page.tsx
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
: Starts the production server.
--- CODE BLOCK 25 ---
export default function Page() {
return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
: Runs ESLint.
Create the
--- CODE BLOCK 26 ---
export default function Page() {
return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
directory
Next.js uses file-system routing, which means the routes in your application are determined by how you structure your files.
Create an
--- CODE BLOCK 37 ---
public/profile.png
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
folder. Then, inside
--- CODE BLOCK 38 ---
/profile.png
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, create a
--- CODE BLOCK 39 ---
import Image from 'next/image'
export default function Page() {
return <Image src="/profile.png" alt="Profile" width={100} height={100} />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
file. This file is the
root layout
. It's required and must contain the
--- CODE BLOCK 40 ---
import Image from 'next/image'
export default function Page() {
return <Image src="/profile.png" alt="Profile" width={100} height={100} />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 41 ---
npm run dev
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
tags.
app/layout.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
--- CODE BLOCK 42 ---
http://localhost:3000
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Create a home page
--- CODE BLOCK 48 ---
tsconfig.json
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
with some initial content:
app/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
--- CODE BLOCK 52 ---
create-next-app
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Both
--- CODE BLOCK 55 ---
"scripts": {
"lint": "next lint"
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 56 ---
"scripts": {
"lint": "next lint"
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
will be rendered when the user visits the root of your application (
--- CODE BLOCK 57 ---
npm run lint
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Good to know
If you forget to create the root layout, Next.js will automatically create this file when running the development server with
--- CODE BLOCK 58 ---
npm run lint
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
You can optionally use a
--- CODE BLOCK 59 ---
npm run lint
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
folder
in the root of your project to separate your application's code from configuration files.
Create the
--- CODE BLOCK 63 ---
eslint-config-next
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
folder (optional)
Create a
--- CODE BLOCK 64 ---
.eslintrc.json
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
folder
at the root of your project to store static assets such as images, fonts, etc. Files inside
--- CODE BLOCK 69 ---
tsconfig.json
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (
--- CODE BLOCK 70 ---
jsconfig.json
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
You can then reference these assets using the root path (
--- CODE BLOCK 71 ---
// Before
import { Button } from '../../../components/button'
// After
import { Button } from '@/components/button'
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
). For example,
--- CODE BLOCK 72 ---
// Before
import { Button } from '../../../components/button'
// After
import { Button } from '@/components/button'
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
can be referenced as
--- CODE BLOCK 74 ---
tsconfig.json
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
app/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
--- CODE BLOCK 75 ---
jsconfig.json
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Run the development server
--- CODE BLOCK 77 ---
"compilerOptions": {
"baseUrl": "src/"
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
to start the development server.
Visit
--- CODE BLOCK 81 ---
@/components/*
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
to view your application.
Edit the
--- CODE BLOCK 82 ---
components/*
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
file and save it to see the updated result in your browser.
Set up TypeScript
Minimum TypeScript version:
--- CODE BLOCK 83 ---
"compilerOptions": {
"baseUrl": "src/",
"paths": {
"@/styles/*": ["styles/*"],
"@/components/*": ["components/*"]
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Next.js comes with built-in TypeScript support. To add TypeScript to your project, rename a file to
--- CODE BLOCK 84 ---
"compilerOptions": {
"baseUrl": "src/",
"paths": {
"@/styles/*": ["styles/*"],
"@/components/*": ["components/*"]
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
[CODE_BLOCK_46]
and run
[CODE_BLOCK_47]
. Next.js will automatically install the necessary dependencies and add a
[CODE_BLOCK_48]
file with the recommended config options.
IDE Plugin
Next.js includes a custom TypeScript plugin and type checker, which VSCode and other code editors can use for advanced type-checking and auto-completion.
You can enable the plugin in VS Code by:
Opening the command palette (
[CODE_BLOCK_49]
[CODE_BLOCK_50]
[CODE_BLOCK_51]
Searching for "TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version"
Selecting "Use Workspace Version"
See the
TypeScript reference
page for more information.
Set up ESLint
Next.js comes with built-in ESLint. It automatically installs the necessary packages and configures the proper settings when you create a new project with
[CODE_BLOCK_52]
To manually add ESLint to an existing project, add
[CODE_BLOCK_53]
as a script to
[CODE_BLOCK_54]
package.json
[CODE_BLOCK_55]
Then, run
[CODE_BLOCK_57]
and you will be guided through the installation and configuration process.
Terminal
[CODE_BLOCK_58]
You'll see a prompt like this:
? How would you like to configure ESLint?
‚ùØ Strict (recommended)
Base
Cancel
Strict
: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration along with a stricter Core Web Vitals rule-set. This is the recommended configuration for developers setting up ESLint for the first time.
Base
: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration.
Cancel
: Skip configuration. Select this option if you plan on setting up your own custom ESLint configuration.
[CODE_BLOCK_60]
[CODE_BLOCK_61]
are selected, Next.js will automatically install
[CODE_BLOCK_62]
[CODE_BLOCK_63]
as dependencies in your application and create an
[CODE_BLOCK_64]
file in the root of your project that includes your selected configuration.
You can now run
[CODE_BLOCK_65]
every time you want to run ESLint to catch errors. Once ESLint has been set up, it will also automatically run during every build (
[CODE_BLOCK_66]
). Errors will fail the build, while warnings will not.
See the
ESLint Plugin
page for more information.
Set up Absolute Imports and Module Path Aliases
Next.js has in-built support for the
[CODE_BLOCK_67]
[CODE_BLOCK_68]
options of
[CODE_BLOCK_69]
[CODE_BLOCK_70]
files.
These options allow you to alias project directories to absolute paths, making it easier and cleaner to import modules. For example:
[CODE_BLOCK_71]
To configure absolute imports, add the
[CODE_BLOCK_73]
configuration option to your
[CODE_BLOCK_74]
[CODE_BLOCK_75]
file. For example:
tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json
[CODE_BLOCK_76]
In addition to configuring the
[CODE_BLOCK_78]
path, you can use the
[CODE_BLOCK_79]
option to
[CODE_BLOCK_80]
module paths.
For example, the following configuration maps
[CODE_BLOCK_81]
[CODE_BLOCK_82]
tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json
[CODE_BLOCK_83]
Each of the
[CODE_BLOCK_85]
are relative to the
[CODE_BLOCK_86]
location.
