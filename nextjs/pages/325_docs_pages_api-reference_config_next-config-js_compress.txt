compress
You are currently viewing the documentation for Pages Router.
compress
By default, Next.js uses
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
Accept-Encoding
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
to compress rendered content and static files when using
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
Content-Encoding
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
or a custom server. This is an optimization for applications that do not have compression configured. If compression is
already
configured in your application via a custom server, Next.js will not add compression.
You can check if compression is enabled and which algorithm is used by looking at the
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
module.exports = {
compress: false,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
(browser accepted options) and
--- CODE BLOCK 8 ---
module.exports = {
compress: false,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
(currently used) headers in the response.
Disabling compression
To disable
compression
, set the
[CODE_BLOCK_5]
config option to
[CODE_BLOCK_6]
next.config.js
[CODE_BLOCK_7]
do not recommend disabling compression
unless you have compression configured on your server, as compression reduces bandwidth usage and improves the performance of your application. For example, you're using
nginx
and want to switch to
[CODE_BLOCK_9]
, set the
[CODE_BLOCK_10]
option to
[CODE_BLOCK_11]
to allow nginx to handle compression.
