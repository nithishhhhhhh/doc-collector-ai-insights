Conflicting Public File and Page File
Conflicting Public File and Page File
Why This Error Occurred
One of your public files has the same path as a page file which is not supported. Since only one resource can reside at the URL both public files and page files must be unique.
Possible Ways to Fix It
Rename either the public file or page file that is causing the conflict.
Example conflict between public file and page file
Folder structure
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
public/
hello
pages/
hello.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Non-conflicting public file and page file
Folder structure
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
public/
hello.txt
pages/
hello.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
