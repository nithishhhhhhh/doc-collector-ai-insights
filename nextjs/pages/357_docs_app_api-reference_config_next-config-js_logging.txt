Fetching
You can configure the logging level and whether the full URL is logged to the console when running Next.js in development mode.
Currently,
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
module.exports = {
logging: {
fetches: {
fullUrl: true,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
only applies to data fetching using the
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
module.exports = {
logging: {
fetches: {
fullUrl: true,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
API. It does not yet apply to other logs inside of Next.js.
next.config.js
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
logging.fetches.hmrRefreshes
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
module.exports = {
logging: {
fetches: {
hmrRefreshes: true,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
requests that are restored from the
Server Components HMR cache
are not logged by default. However, this can be enabled by setting
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
incomingRequests
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 11 ---
module.exports = {
logging: {
incomingRequests: {
ignore: [/\api\/v1\/health/],
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
next.config.js
--- CODE BLOCK 12 ---
module.exports = {
logging: {
incomingRequests: {
ignore: [/\api\/v1\/health/],
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Incoming Requests
By default all the incoming requests will be logged in the console during development. You can use the
--- CODE BLOCK 15 ---
module.exports = {
logging: {
incomingRequests: false,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
option to decide which requests to ignore.
Since this is only logged in development, this option doesn't affect production builds.
next.config.js
--- CODE BLOCK 16 ---
module.exports = {
logging: {
incomingRequests: false,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Or you can disable incoming request logging by setting
--- CODE BLOCK 20 ---
module.exports = {
logging: false,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
