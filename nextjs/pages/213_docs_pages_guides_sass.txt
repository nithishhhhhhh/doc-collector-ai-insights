How to use Sass in Next.js
Next.js has built-in support for integrating with Sass after the package is installed using both the
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
.module.scss
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
.module.sass
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
extensions. You can use component-level Sass via CSS Modules and the
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
npm install --save-dev sass
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
npm install --save-dev sass
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
extension.
First, install
--- CODE BLOCK 11 ---
sassOptions
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Terminal
--- CODE BLOCK 12 ---
next.config
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Good to know
Sass supports
two different syntaxes
, each with their own extension.
--- CODE BLOCK 14 ---
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
sassOptions: {
additionalData: `$var: red;`,
export default nextConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
extension requires you use the
SCSS syntax
while the
--- CODE BLOCK 15 ---
implementation
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
extension requires you use the
Indented Syntax ("Sass")
If you're not sure which to choose, start with the
--- CODE BLOCK 17 ---
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
sassOptions: {
implementation: 'sass-embedded',
export default nextConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
extension which is a superset of CSS, and doesn't require you learn the
Indented Syntax ("Sass").
Customizing Sass Options
If you want to configure your Sass options, use
--- CODE BLOCK 18 ---
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
sassOptions: {
implementation: 'sass-embedded',
export default nextConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 19 ---
primaryColor
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
next.config.ts
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
--- CODE BLOCK 20 ---
$primary-color: #64ff00;
:export {
primaryColor: $primary-color;
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Implementation
You can use the
--- CODE BLOCK 22 ---
import variables from '../styles/variables.module.scss'
export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
return (
<Layout color={variables.primaryColor}>
<Component {...pageProps} />
</Layout>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
property to specify the Sass implementation to use. By default, Next.js uses the
--- CODE BLOCK 23 ---
import variables from '../styles/variables.module.scss'
export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
return (
<Layout color={variables.primaryColor}>
<Component {...pageProps} />
</Layout>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
package.
next.config.ts
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_17]
Sass Variables
Next.js supports Sass variables exported from CSS Module files.
For example, using the exported
[CODE_BLOCK_19]
Sass variable:
app/variables.module.scss
[CODE_BLOCK_20]
pages/_app.js
[CODE_BLOCK_22]
