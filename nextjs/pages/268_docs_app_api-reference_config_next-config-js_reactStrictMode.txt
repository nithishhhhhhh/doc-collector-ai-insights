Good to know
: Since Next.js 13.5.1, Strict Mode is
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
reactStrictMode: false
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
by default with
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
next.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
router, so the above configuration is only necessary for
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
module.exports = {
reactStrictMode: true,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
. You can still disable Strict Mode by setting
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
module.exports = {
reactStrictMode: true,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Suggested
: We strongly suggest you enable Strict Mode in your Next.js application to better prepare your application for the future of React.

The Next.js runtime is Strict Mode-compliant. To opt-in to Strict Mode, configure the following option in your
--- CODE BLOCK 8 ---
<React.StrictMode>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
next.config.js
[CODE_BLOCK_6]
If you or your team are not ready to use Strict Mode in your entire application, that's OK! You can incrementally migrate on a page-by-page basis using
