Parameters
--- CODE BLOCK 8 ---
setInterval()

The identifier of the repeated action you want to cancel. This ID was returned by
the corresponding call to

It's worth noting that the pool of IDs used by
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
clearInterval()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 11 ---
clearTimeout()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
are shared, which
means you can technically use
--- CODE BLOCK 13 ---
setInterval()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 14 ---
Window.setInterval()
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
interchangeably.
However, for clarity, you should avoid doing so.
Return value

--- CODE BLOCK 15 ---
WorkerGlobalScope.clearInterval()
