file is used to render a fallback within
Parallel Routes
when Next.js cannot recover a
slot's
active state after a full-page load.
During
soft navigation
, Next.js keeps track of the active
state
(subpage) for each slot. However, for hard navigations (full-page load), Next.js cannot recover the active state. In this case, a
--- CODE BLOCK 19 ---
export default async function Default({
params,
}: {
params: Promise<{ artist: string }>
}) {
const { artist } = await params
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
file can be rendered for subpages that don't match the current URL.
Consider the following folder structure. The
--- CODE BLOCK 21 ---
app/[artist]/@sidebar/default.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
slot has a
--- CODE BLOCK 23 ---
Promise<{ artist: 'zack' }>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
page, but
--- CODE BLOCK 24 ---
app/[artist]/[album]/@sidebar/default.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
does not.
When navigating to
--- CODE BLOCK 26 ---
Promise<{ artist: 'zack', album: 'next' }>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, the
--- CODE BLOCK 28 ---
async/await
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
slot will render the
[CODE_BLOCK_8]
page while maintaining the currently active page for the
[CODE_BLOCK_9]
slot.
On refresh, Next.js will render a
[CODE_BLOCK_10]
[CODE_BLOCK_11]
. If
[CODE_BLOCK_12]
doesn't exist, a
[CODE_BLOCK_13]
is rendered instead.
Additionally, since
[CODE_BLOCK_14]
is an implicit slot, you also need to create a
[CODE_BLOCK_15]
file to render a fallback for
[CODE_BLOCK_16]
when Next.js cannot recover the active state of the parent page.
Reference
[CODE_BLOCK_17]
(optional)
A promise that resolves to an object containing the
dynamic route parameters
from the root segment down to the slot's subpages. For example:
app/[artist]/@sidebar/default.js
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_18]
Example
[CODE_BLOCK_20]
[CODE_BLOCK_21]
[CODE_BLOCK_22]
[CODE_BLOCK_23]
[CODE_BLOCK_24]
[CODE_BLOCK_25]
[CODE_BLOCK_26]
Since the
[CODE_BLOCK_27]
prop is a promise. You must use
[CODE_BLOCK_28]
or React's
[CODE_BLOCK_29]
function to access the values.
In version 14 and earlier,
[CODE_BLOCK_30]
was a synchronous prop. To help with backwards compatibility, you can still access it synchronously in Next.js 15, but this behavior will be deprecated in the future.

Parallel Routes
Simultaneously render one or more pages in the same view that can be navigated independently. A pattern for highly dynamic applications.
