Examples
Using the debugger statement
The following example shows code where a
[CODE_BLOCK_4]
statement has been
inserted, to invoke a debugger (if one exists) when the function is called.
Copy to Clipboard
[CODE_BLOCK_5]
When the debugger is invoked, execution is paused at the
[CODE_BLOCK_7]
statement. It is like a breakpoint in the script source.
