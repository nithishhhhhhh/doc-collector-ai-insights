productionBrowserSourceMaps
Source Maps are enabled by default during development. During production builds, they are disabled to prevent you leaking your source on the client, unless you specifically opt-in with the configuration flag.
Next.js provides a configuration flag you can use to enable browser source map generation during the production build:
next.config.js
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
module.exports = {
productionBrowserSourceMaps: true,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
When the
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
productionBrowserSourceMaps
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
option is enabled, the source maps will be output in the same directory as the JavaScript files. Next.js will automatically serve these files when requested.
Adding source maps can increase
[CODE_BLOCK_4]
time
Increases memory usage during
[CODE_BLOCK_5]
