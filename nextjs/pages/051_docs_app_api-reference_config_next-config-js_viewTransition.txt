viewTransition
This feature is currently experimental and subject to change, it's not recommended for production. Try it out and share your feedback on
GitHub
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
viewTransition
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
is an experimental flag that enables the new experimental
View Transitions API
in React. This API allows you to leverage the native View Transitions browser API to create seamless transitions between UI states.
To enable this feature, you need to set the
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
viewTransition
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
property to
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
next.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
in your
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
experimental: {
viewTransition: true,
module.exports = nextConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
file.
next.config.js
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
experimental: {
viewTransition: true,
module.exports = nextConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Important Notice: This feature is not developed or maintained by the Next.js team — it is an experimental API from the React team. It is still in
early stages
not recommended for production use
. The implementation is still being iterated on, and its behavior may change in future React releases.
Enabling this feature requires understanding the experimental nature of the API. To fully grasp its behavior, refer to the
React pull request
and related discussions.
Usage
Once enabled, you can import the
--- CODE BLOCK 8 ---
import { unstable_ViewTransition as ViewTransition } from 'react'
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
component from React in your application:
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
import { unstable_ViewTransition as ViewTransition } from 'react'
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
However, documentation and examples are currently limited, and you will need to refer directly to React’s source code and discussions to understand how this works.
Live Demo

Next.js View Transition Demo

As this API evolves, we will update our documentation and share more examples. However, for now, we strongly advise against using this feature in production.
