How to use markdown and MDX in Next.js
Markdown
is a lightweight markup language used to format text. It allows you to write using plain text syntax and convert it to structurally valid HTML. It's commonly used for writing content on websites and blogs.
You write...
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
I **love** using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Output:
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
<p>I <strong>love</strong> using <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a></p>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
is a superset of markdown that lets you write
directly in your markdown files. It is a powerful way to add dynamic interactivity and embed React components within your content.
Next.js can support both local MDX content inside your application, as well as remote MDX files fetched dynamically on the server. The Next.js plugin handles transforming markdown and React components into HTML, including support for usage in Server Components (the default in App Router).

npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react @types/mdx
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
package, and related packages, are used to configure Next.js so it can process markdown and MDX.
It sources data from local files
, allowing you to create pages with a
--- CODE BLOCK 11 ---

const nextConfig = {
// Configure `pageExtensions` to include markdown and MDX files

// Optionally, add any other Next.js config below
const withMDX = createMDX({
// Add markdown plugins here, as desired

directory.
Install these packages to render MDX with Next.js:
Terminal
--- CODE BLOCK 15 ---
import createMDX from '@next/mdx'
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
// Configure `pageExtensions` to include markdown and MDX files
pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],
// Optionally, add any other Next.js config below
const withMDX = createMDX({
// Add markdown plugins here, as desired
// Merge MDX config with Next.js config
export default withMDX(nextConfig)
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Configure
--- CODE BLOCK 23 ---

extension: /\.(md|mdx)$/,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Update the

--- END CODE BLOCK ---
file at your project's root to configure it to use MDX:
next.config.mjs
--- CODE BLOCK 27 ---
mdx-components.tsx
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
This allows

Learn how to
use custom styles and components
Rendering MDX
You can render MDX using Next.js's file based routing or by importing MDX files into other pages.
Using file based routing
When using file based routing, you can use MDX pages like any other page.
In App Router apps, that includes being able to use
metadata
Create a new MDX page within the
--- CODE BLOCK 62 ---
import type { MDXComponents } from 'mdx/types'
import Image, { ImageProps } from 'next/image'
// This file allows you to provide custom React components
// to be used in MDX files. You can import and use any
// React component you want, including inline styles,
// components from other libraries, and more.
export function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
return {
// Allows customizing built-in components, e.g. to add styling.
h1: ({ children }) => (
<h1 style={{ color: 'red', fontSize: '48px' }}>{children}</h1>
img: (props) => (
<Image
sizes="100vw"
style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
{...(props as ImageProps)}
...components,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
directory:
--- CODE BLOCK 63 ---
import type { MDXComponents } from 'mdx/types'
import Image, { ImageProps } from 'next/image'
// This file allows you to provide custom React components
// to be used in MDX files. You can import and use any
// React component you want, including inline styles,
// components from other libraries, and more.
export function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
return {
// Allows customizing built-in components, e.g. to add styling.
h1: ({ children }) => (
<h1 style={{ color: 'red', fontSize: '48px' }}>{children}</h1>
img: (props) => (
<Image
sizes="100vw"
style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
{...(props as ImageProps)}
...components,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
You can use MDX in these files, and even import React components, directly inside your MDX page:
--- CODE BLOCK 65 ---
import Welcome from '@/markdown/welcome.mdx'
function CustomH1({ children }) {
return <h1 style={{ color: 'blue', fontSize: '100px' }}>{children}</h1>
const overrideComponents = {
h1: CustomH1,
export default function Page() {
return <Welcome components={overrideComponents} />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Navigating to the
--- CODE BLOCK 67 ---
export default function MdxLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
// Create any shared layout or styles here
return <div style={{ color: 'blue' }}>{children}</div>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
route should display your rendered MDX page.
Using imports
Create a new page within the
--- CODE BLOCK 68 ---
@tailwindcss/typography
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
directory and an MDX file wherever you'd like:
--- CODE BLOCK 71 ---
export default function MdxLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
// Create any shared layout or styles here
return (
<div className="prose prose-headings:mt-8 prose-headings:font-semibold prose-headings:text-black prose-h1:text-5xl prose-h2:text-4xl prose-h3:text-3xl prose-h4:text-2xl prose-h5:text-xl prose-h6:text-lg dark:prose-headings:text-white">
{children}
</div>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
You can use MDX in these files, and even import React components, directly inside your MDX page:
Import the MDX file inside the page to display the content:
app/mdx-page/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
--- CODE BLOCK 75 ---
import BlogPost, { metadata } from '@/content/blog-post.mdx'
export default function Page() {
console.log('metadata: ', metadata)
//=> { author: 'John Doe' }
return <BlogPost />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Navigating to the
--- CODE BLOCK 81 ---
next.config.mjs
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
route should display your rendered MDX page.
Using dynamic imports
You can import dynamic MDX components instead of using filesystem routing for MDX files.
For example, you can have a dynamic route segment which loads MDX components from a separate directory:
--- CODE BLOCK 82 ---
next.config.ts
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
can be used to prerender the provided routes. By marking
--- CODE BLOCK 83 ---
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'
import createMDX from '@next/mdx'
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
// Allow .mdx extensions for files
pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],
// Optionally, add any other Next.js config below
const withMDX = createMDX({
// Add markdown plugins here, as desired
options: {
remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
rehypePlugins: [],
// Combine MDX and Next.js config
export default withMDX(nextConfig)
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 84 ---
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'
import createMDX from '@next/mdx'
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
// Allow .mdx extensions for files
pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],
// Optionally, add any other Next.js config below
const withMDX = createMDX({
// Add markdown plugins here, as desired
options: {
remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
rehypePlugins: [],
// Combine MDX and Next.js config
export default withMDX(nextConfig)
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, accessing a route not defined in
--- CODE BLOCK 86 ---
import createMDX from '@next/mdx'
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],
const withMDX = createMDX({
options: {
remarkPlugins: [],
rehypePlugins: [['rehype-katex', { strict: true, throwOnError: true }]],
export default withMDX(nextConfig)
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
will 404.

const withMDX = createMDX({
options: {
remarkPlugins: [],
rehypePlugins: [['rehype-katex', { strict: true, throwOnError: true }]],
export default withMDX(nextConfig)
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Good to know
: Ensure you specify the
--- CODE BLOCK 89 ---
next-mdx-remote-client
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
file extension in your import. While it is not required to use
module path aliases
(e.g.,
--- CODE BLOCK 90 ---
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote-client/rsc'
export default async function RemoteMdxPage() {
// MDX text - can be from a database, CMS, fetch, anywhere...
const res = await fetch('https://...')
const markdown = await res.text()
return <MDXRemote source={markdown} />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
), it does simplify your import path.
Using custom styles and components
Markdown, when rendered, maps to native HTML elements. For example, writing the following markdown:
--- CODE BLOCK 91 ---
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote-client/rsc'
export default async function RemoteMdxPage() {
// MDX text - can be from a database, CMS, fetch, anywhere...
const res = await fetch('https://...')
const markdown = await res.text()
return <MDXRemote source={markdown} />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Generates the following HTML:
--- CODE BLOCK 97 ---
import { unified } from 'unified'
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
import remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'
import rehypeSanitize from 'rehype-sanitize'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'
main()
async function main() {
const file = await unified()
.use(remarkParse) // Convert into markdown AST
.use(remarkRehype) // Transform to HTML AST
.use(rehypeSanitize) // Sanitize HTML input
.use(rehypeStringify) // Convert AST into serialized HTML
.process('Hello, Next.js!')
console.log(String(file)) // <p>Hello, Next.js!</p>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
To style your markdown, you can provide custom components that map to the generated HTML elements. Styles and components can be implemented globally, locally, and with shared layouts.
Global styles and components
Adding styles and components in
--- CODE BLOCK 105 ---
next.config.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
will affect
MDX files in your application.
mdx-components.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
--- CODE BLOCK 107 ---
module.exports = withMDX({
experimental: {
mdxRs: true,
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Local styles and components
You can apply local styles and components to specific pages by passing them into imported MDX components. These will merge with and override
global styles and components
app/mdx-page/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
--- CODE BLOCK 110 ---
module.exports = withMDX({
experimental: {
mdxRs: {
jsxRuntime?: string            // Custom jsx runtime
jsxImportSource?: string       // Custom jsx import source,
mdxType?: 'gfm' | 'commonmark' // Configure what kind of mdx syntax will be used to parse & transform
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Shared layouts
To share a layout across MDX pages, you can use the
built-in layouts support
with the App Router.
app/mdx-page/layout.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_66]
Using Tailwind typography plugin
If you are using
Tailwind
to style your application, using the
[CODE_BLOCK_68]
plugin
will allow you to reuse your Tailwind configuration and styles in your markdown files.
The plugin adds a set of
[CODE_BLOCK_69]
classes that can be used to add typographic styles to content blocks that come from sources, like markdown.
Install Tailwind typography
and use with
shared layouts
to add the
[CODE_BLOCK_70]
you want.
app/mdx-page/layout.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_71]
Frontmatter
Frontmatter is a YAML like key/value pairing that can be used to store data about a page.
[CODE_BLOCK_73]
does
support frontmatter by default, though there are many solutions for adding frontmatter to your MDX content, such as:
remark-frontmatter
remark-mdx-frontmatter
gray-matter
[CODE_BLOCK_74]
does
allow you to use exports like any other JavaScript component:
Metadata can now be referenced outside of the MDX file:
app/blog/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_75]
A common use case for this is when you want to iterate over a collection of MDX and extract data. For example, creating a blog index page from all blog posts. You can use packages like
Node's
[CODE_BLOCK_77]
module
globby
to read a directory of posts and extract the metadata.
Good to know
Using
[CODE_BLOCK_78]
[CODE_BLOCK_79]
, etc. can only be used server-side.
View the
Portfolio Starter Kit
template for a complete working example.
remark and rehype Plugins
You can optionally provide remark and rehype plugins to transform the MDX content.
For example, you can use
[CODE_BLOCK_80]
to support GitHub Flavored Markdown.
Since the remark and rehype ecosystem is ESM only, you'll need to use
[CODE_BLOCK_81]
[CODE_BLOCK_82]
as the configuration file.
next.config.mjs
[CODE_BLOCK_83]
Using Plugins with Turbopack
To use plugins with
Turbopack
, upgrade to the latest
[CODE_BLOCK_85]
and specify plugin names using a string:
next.config.mjs
[CODE_BLOCK_86]
Good to know
remark and rehype plugins without serializable options cannot be used yet with
Turbopack
, due to
inability to pass JavaScript functions to Rust
Remote MDX
If your MDX files or content lives
somewhere else
, you can fetch it dynamically on the server. This is useful for content stored in a CMS, database, or anywhere else. A community package for this use is
[CODE_BLOCK_88]
Good to know
: Please proceed with caution. MDX compiles to JavaScript and is executed on the server. You should only fetch MDX content from a trusted source, otherwise this can lead to remote code execution (RCE).
The following example uses
[CODE_BLOCK_89]
app/mdx-page-remote/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
[CODE_BLOCK_90]
Navigating to the
[CODE_BLOCK_92]
route should display your rendered MDX.
Deep Dive: How do you transform markdown into HTML?
React does not natively understand markdown. The markdown plaintext needs to first be transformed into HTML. This can be accomplished with
[CODE_BLOCK_93]
[CODE_BLOCK_94]
[CODE_BLOCK_95]
is an ecosystem of tools around markdown.
[CODE_BLOCK_96]
is the same, but for HTML. For example, the following code snippet transforms markdown into HTML:
[CODE_BLOCK_97]
[CODE_BLOCK_99]
[CODE_BLOCK_100]
ecosystem contains plugins for
syntax highlighting
linking headings
generating a table of contents
, and more.
When using
[CODE_BLOCK_101]
as shown above, you
do not
need to use
[CODE_BLOCK_102]
[CODE_BLOCK_103]
directly, as it is handled for you. We're describing it here for a deeper understanding of what the
[CODE_BLOCK_104]
package is doing underneath.
Using the Rust-based MDX compiler (experimental)
Next.js supports a new MDX compiler written in Rust. This compiler is still experimental and is not recommended for production use. To use the new compiler, you need to configure
[CODE_BLOCK_105]
when you pass it to
[CODE_BLOCK_106]
next.config.js
