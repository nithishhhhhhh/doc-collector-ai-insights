Tailwind CSS
How to install Tailwind CSS in your Next.js application
Tailwind CSS
is a utility-first CSS framework that is fully compatible with Next.js. This guide will walk you through how to install Tailwind CSS in your Next.js application.
Installing Tailwind
Install the necessary Tailwind CSS packages:
Terminal
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
npm install -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Good to know
: If you're using the
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
create-next-app
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
CLI to create your project, Next.js will prompt if you'd like to install Tailwind and automatically configure the project.
Configuring Tailwind
Create a
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
postcss.config.mjs
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
file in the root of your project and add the
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
@tailwindcss/postcss
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
plugin to your PostCSS configuration:
postcss.config.mjs
--- CODE BLOCK 6 ---
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
plugins: {
'@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
As of
Tailwind v4
, there is zero configuration required by default. If you do need to configure Tailwind, you can follow the
official documentation
for configuring the global CSS file.
There is also an
upgrade CLI
guide
if you have an existing Tailwind v3 project.
Importing Styles
Add the
Tailwind CSS directives
that Tailwind will use to inject its generated styles to a
Global Stylesheet
in your application, for example:
app/globals.css
--- CODE BLOCK 8 ---
@import 'tailwindcss';
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Inside the
root layout
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
app/layout.tsx
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
), import the
--- CODE BLOCK 11 ---
globals.css
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
stylesheet to apply the styles to every route in your application.
app/layout.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
--- CODE BLOCK 12 ---
import type { Metadata } from 'next'
// These styles apply to every route in the application
import './globals.css'
export const metadata: Metadata = {
title: 'Create Next App',
description: 'Generated by create next app',
export default function RootLayout({
children,
}: {
children: React.ReactNode
}) {
return (
<html lang="en">
<body>{children}</body>
</html>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Using Classes
After installing Tailwind CSS and adding the global styles, you can use Tailwind's utility classes in your application.
app/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
--- CODE BLOCK 14 ---
export default function Page() {
return <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline">Hello, Next.js!</h1>
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
