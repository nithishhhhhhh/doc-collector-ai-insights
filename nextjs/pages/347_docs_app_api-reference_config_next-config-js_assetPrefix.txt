Attention
Deploying to Vercel
automatically configures a global CDN for your Next.js project.
You do not need to manually setup an Asset Prefix.
Good to know
: Next.js 9.5+ added support for a customizable
Base Path
, which is better
suited for hosting your application on a sub-path like
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
next.config.mjs
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
We do not suggest you use a custom Asset Prefix for this use case.
Set up a CDN
To set up a
, you can set up an asset prefix and configure your CDN's origin to resolve to the domain that Next.js is hosted on.
Open
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
assetPrefix
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
and add the
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
// @ts-check
import { PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER } from 'next/constants'
export default (phase) => {
const isDev = phase === PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER
* @type {import('next').NextConfig}
const nextConfig = {
assetPrefix: isDev ? undefined : 'https://cdn.mydomain.com',
return nextConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
config based on the
phase
next.config.mjs
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
// @ts-check
import { PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER } from 'next/constants'
export default (phase) => {
const isDev = phase === PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER
* @type {import('next').NextConfig}
const nextConfig = {
assetPrefix: isDev ? undefined : 'https://cdn.mydomain.com',
return nextConfig
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Next.js will automatically use your asset prefix for the JavaScript and CSS files it loads from the
--- CODE BLOCK 8 ---
/_next/static/chunks/4b9b41aaa062cbbfeff4add70f256968c51ece5d.4d708494b3aed70c04f0.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
path (
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
/_next/static/chunks/4b9b41aaa062cbbfeff4add70f256968c51ece5d.4d708494b3aed70c04f0.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
folder). For example, with the above configuration, the following request for a JS chunk:
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
https://cdn.mydomain.com/_next/static/chunks/4b9b41aaa062cbbfeff4add70f256968c51ece5d.4d708494b3aed70c04f0.js
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Would instead become:
--- CODE BLOCK 12 ---
.next/static/
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
The exact configuration for uploading your files to a given CDN will depend on your CDN of choice. The only folder you need to host on your CDN is the contents of
--- CODE BLOCK 15 ---
assetPrefix
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, which should be uploaded as
--- CODE BLOCK 16 ---
_next/static
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
as the above URL request indicates.
Do not upload the rest of your
[CODE_BLOCK_14]
folder
, as you should not expose your server code and other configuration to the public.
While
[CODE_BLOCK_15]
covers requests to
[CODE_BLOCK_16]
, it does not influence the following paths:
Files in the
public
folder; if you want to serve those assets over a CDN, you'll have to introduce the prefix yourself
