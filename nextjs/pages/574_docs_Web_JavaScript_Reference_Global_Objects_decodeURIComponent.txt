function containsEncodedComponents(x) {
// ie ?,=,&,/ etc
return decodeURI(x) !== decodeURIComponent(x);
console.log(containsEncodedComponents("%3Fx%3Dtest")); // ?x=test

} catch (e) {
console.error(e);
// URIError: malformed URI sequence
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
. It decodes
escape sequences, including those that are not created by
