Netlify supports all major Next.js features with zero configuration.
Under the hood, this is powered by our OpenNext adapter, which we maintain in the open and test alongside every stable release of Next.js.
For earlier Next.js versions
The information on this page is applies to Next.js version 13.5 and above. For earlier Next.js versions, visit the
legacy runtime
page.
Get started
If you have an existing Next.js app you’d like to deploy, push your code to a Git provider and connect it through the Netlify Dashboard.
When starting from scratch, the fastest way is to deploy our
Next.js platform starter template
to your Netlify account.
Key features
App Router:
Netlify fully supports the Next.js App Router, which supports more powerful nested layouts and React’s latest features, such as Server Components and Streaming.
Automatic fine-grained caching:
the adapter uses our
fine-grained caching primitives
to support the Next.js Full Route Cache and Data Cache. This means that static page responses are automatically cached at the edge and can be revalidated by path or by tag.
On-demand and time-based revalidation:
both the App Router and Pages Router support on-demand and time-based revalidation, allowing you to revalidate and regenerate content at any time after a deploy.
Image optimization:

component uses
Netlify Image CDN
by default, to ensure your images are optimized and served in the most efficient format.
Next.js support on Netlify
The following tables show you a comprehensive mapping of critical Next.js features and how Netlify supports them. Netlify supports new Next.js features as early as possible, but experimental features may not be fully stable yet.

How Netlify runs your Next.js app
Netlify automatically configures your site to support modern Next.js features out of the box. This is powered by our OpenNext adapter, an open source project that provisions the correct infrastructure for each part of your Next.js application without custom configuration.
We recommend that you don’t pin the adapter version. We actively maintain the adapter to support all Next.js versions starting from version 13.5 and, if you don’t pin the version, we will automatically update the adapter to the latest version on each site build for you.
What the adapter does
When you deploy a Next.js project on Netlify, the adapter automatically:
Provisions Netlify Functions for:
Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
Partial Prerendering (PPR)
API routes
Server Actions
Provisions Netlify Edge Functions for:
Next.js Middleware
Geolocation- and routing-based personalization
Fast execution at the network edge
Configures caching and revalidation with:
Next.js Full Route Cache and Data Cache
Tag-based or path-based revalidation
Enables image optimization with the Netlify Image CDN and

Compatibility and testing
We verify compatibility with every new stable version of Next.js. Each release of the adapter is tested using:
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
npm install @netlify/plugin-nextjs@<version>
Copy to Clipboard
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Reverting to an older adapter version
Not recommended
We recommend that you don’t pin the adapter version. We actively maintain the adapter to support all Next.js versions starting from version 13.5 and, if you don’t pin the version, we will automatically use the latest version on each site build for you.
To pin a specific version of the adapter:
Install the version you want in
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
netlify.toml
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
[[plugins]]
package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
Copy to Clipboard
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Add the plugin to your

@netlify/plugin-nextjs

package.json

Limitations
Open issues are documented in the
end-to-end test report page
Edge Runtime Location:
SSR pages using the edge runtime run in your functions region rather than true edge locations
Rewrite Limitations:
Rewrites in Next.js configuration can’t point to static files in the public directory.
Middleware Execution Order:
Headers and redirects are evaluated after middleware, differing from stand-alone Next.js behavior.
Forms Integration:
Netlify Forms requires a specific workaround when used with Next.js applications.
