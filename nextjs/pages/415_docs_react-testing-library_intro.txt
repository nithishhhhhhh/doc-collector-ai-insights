React Testing Library
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
builds on top of
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
DOM Testing Library
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
by adding
APIs for working with React components.
Installation
To get started with
--- CODE BLOCK 3 ---
React Testing Library
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
, you'll need to install it together
with its peerDependency
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
@testing-library/dom
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Yarn
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 7 ---
yarn add --dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
With TypeScript
To get full type coverage, you need to install the types for
--- CODE BLOCK 11 ---
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom @types/react @types/react-dom
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 12 ---
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom @types/react @types/react-dom
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
as well:
Yarn
--- CODE BLOCK 13 ---
yarn add --dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom @types/react @types/react-dom

The problem
You want to write maintainable tests for your React components. As a part of
this goal, you want your tests to avoid including implementation details of your
components and rather focus on making your tests give you the confidence for
which they are intended. As part of this, you want your testbase to be
maintainable in the long run so refactors of your components (changes to
implementation but not functionality) don't break your tests and slow you and
your team down.
This solution
--- CODE BLOCK 18 ---
data-testid
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
is a very light-weight solution for testing React
components. It provides light utility functions on top of
--- CODE BLOCK 19 ---
DOM Testing Library
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
[CODE_BLOCK_17]
, in a way that encourages better testing practices. Its
primary guiding principle is:
The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.
So rather than dealing with instances of rendered React components, your tests
will work with actual DOM nodes. The utilities this library provides facilitate
querying the DOM in the same way the user would. Finding form elements by their
label text (just like a user would), finding links and buttons from their text
(like a user would). It also exposes a recommended way to find elements by a
[CODE_BLOCK_18]
as an "escape hatch" for elements where the text content and label
do not make sense or is not practical.
This library encourages your applications to be more accessible and allows you
to get your tests closer to using your components the way a user will, which
allows your tests to give you more confidence that your application will work
when a real user uses it.
This library is a replacement for
Enzyme
. While you
follow these guidelines using Enzyme itself, enforcing this is harder
because of all the extra utilities that Enzyme provides (utilities which
facilitate testing implementation details). Read more about this in
the FAQ
What this library is not
A test runner or framework
Specific to a testing framework (though we recommend Jest as our preference,
the library works with any framework. See
Using Without Jest
NOTE: This library is built on top of
[CODE_BLOCK_19]
which is where most of
the logic behind the queries is.
