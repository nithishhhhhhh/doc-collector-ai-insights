web application manifest
, defined in the
Web Application Manifest
specification, is a
JSON
text file that provides information about a web application.
The most common use for a web application manifest is to provide information that the browser needs to install a
progressive web app
(PWA) on a device, such as the app's name and icon.
A web application manifest contains a single JSON object where the top-level keys are called
members
Members
This section lists
reference pages for manifest members
that are documented on MDN.
All members are optional in the specification, but some applications require some members to be present. For example,
PWAs must provide certain manifest members

Deploying a manifest
Web app manifests are deployed in your HTML pages using a
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
.webmanifest
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
element in the
--- CODE BLOCK 11 ---
Content-Type: application/manifest+json
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
of a document:
html
Copy to Clipboard
--- CODE BLOCK 13 ---
Content-Type: application/json
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 15 ---
use-credentials
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
extension is specified in the
Media type registration
section of the specification (the response of the manifest file should return
--- CODE BLOCK 16 ---
<link rel="manifest" href="/app.webmanifest" crossorigin="use-credentials" />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
). Browsers generally support manifests with other appropriate extensions like
--- CODE BLOCK 17 ---
<link rel="manifest" href="/app.webmanifest" crossorigin="use-credentials" />
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 19 ---
background_color
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
If the manifest requires credentials to fetch, the
[CODE_BLOCK_14]
attribute must be set to
[CODE_BLOCK_15]
, even if the manifest file is in the same origin as the current page.

Splash screens
In some browsers and operating systems, a splash screen is displayed when an installed PWA is launched. This splash screen is automatically generated and its appearance is defined by members in the web app manifest, specifically:
[CODE_BLOCK_18]
[CODE_BLOCK_19]
[CODE_BLOCK_20]
