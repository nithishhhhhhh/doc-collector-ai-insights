serverActions
Options for configuring Server Actions behavior in your Next.js application.
--- CODE BLOCK 1 ---
allowedOrigins
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
A list of extra safe origin domains from which Server Actions can be invoked. Next.js compares the origin of a Server Action request with the host domain, ensuring they match to prevent CSRF attacks. If not provided, only the same origin is allowed.
next.config.js
--- CODE BLOCK 2 ---
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
module.exports = {
experimental: {
serverActions: {
allowedOrigins: ['my-proxy.com', '*.my-proxy.com'],
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 4 ---
bodySizeLimit
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
By default, the maximum size of the request body sent to a Server Action is 1MB, to prevent the consumption of excessive server resources in parsing large amounts of data, as well as potential DDoS attacks.
However, you can configure this limit using the
--- CODE BLOCK 5 ---
serverActions.bodySizeLimit
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
option. It can take the number of bytes or any string format supported by bytes, for example
--- CODE BLOCK 9 ---
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
module.exports = {
experimental: {
serverActions: {
bodySizeLimit: '2mb',
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 10 ---
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
module.exports = {
experimental: {
serverActions: {
bodySizeLimit: '2mb',
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
--- CODE BLOCK 11 ---
experimental.serverActions
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
next.config.js
--- CODE BLOCK 13 ---
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const config = {
experimental: {
serverActions: true,
module.exports = config
--- END CODE BLOCK ---
Enabling Server Actions (v13)
Server Actions became a stable feature in Next.js 14, and are enabled by default. However, if you are using an earlier version of Next.js, you can enable them by setting
