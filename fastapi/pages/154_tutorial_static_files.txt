Static FilesÂ¶
=============

Static Files
You can serve static files automatically from a directory using
StaticFiles
.
Use
StaticFiles
Import
StaticFiles
.
"Mount" a
StaticFiles()
instance in a specific path.
Python 3.8+
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
from
fastapi.staticfiles
import
StaticFiles
app
=
FastAPI
()
app
.
mount
(
"/static"
,
StaticFiles
(
directory
=
"static"
),
name
=
"static"
)
Technical Details
You could also use
from starlette.staticfiles import StaticFiles
.
FastAPI
provides the same
starlette.staticfiles
as
fastapi.staticfiles
just as a convenience for you, the developer. But it actually comes directly from Starlette.
What is "Mounting"
"Mounting" means adding a complete "independent" application in a specific path, that then takes care of handling all the sub-paths.
This is different from using an
APIRouter
as a mounted application is completely independent. The OpenAPI and docs from your main application won't include anything from the mounted application, etc.
You can read more about this in the
Advanced User Guide
.
Details
The first
"/static"
refers to the sub-path this "sub-application" will be "mounted" on. So, any path that starts with
"/static"
will be handled by it.
The
directory="static"
refers to the name of the directory that contains your static files.
The
name="static"
gives it a name that can be used internally by
FastAPI
.
All these parameters can be different than "
static
", adjust them with the needs and specific details of your own application.
