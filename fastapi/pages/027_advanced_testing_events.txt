===================================

Testing Events: startup - shutdown
When you need your event handlers (
startup
and
shutdown
) to run in your tests, you can use the
TestClient
with a
with
statement:
Python 3.8+
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
from
fastapi.testclient
import
TestClient
app
=
FastAPI
()
items
=
{}
@app
.
on_event
(
"startup"
)
async
def
startup_event
():
items
[
"foo"
]
=
{
"name"
:
"Fighters"
}
items
[
"bar"
]
=
{
"name"
:
"Tenders"
}
@app
.
get
(
"/items/
{item_id}
"
)
async
def
read_items
(
item_id
:
str
):
return
items
[
item_id
]
def
test_read_items
():
with
TestClient
(
app
)
as
client
:
response
=
client
.
get
(
"/items/foo"
)
assert
response
.
status_code
==
200
assert
response
.
json
()
==
{
"name"
:
"Fighters"
}
