Tutorial - User Guide
This tutorial shows you how to use
FastAPI
with most of its features, step by step.
Each section gradually builds on the previous ones, but it's structured to separate topics, so that you can go directly to any specific one to solve your specific API needs.
It is also built to work as a future reference so you can come back and see exactly what you need.
Run the code
All the code blocks can be copied and used directly (they are actually tested Python files).
To run any of the examples, copy the code to a file
main.py
, and start
fastapi dev
with:
fast ‚Üí
fastapi dev main.py

It is
HIGHLY encouraged
that you write or copy the code, edit it and run it locally.
Using it in your editor is what really shows you the benefits of FastAPI, seeing how little code you have to write, all the type checks, autocompletion, etc.
Install FastAPI
The first step is to install FastAPI.
Make sure you create a
virtual environment
, activate it, and then
install FastAPI
:
fast ‚Üí
pip install "fastapi[standard]"
restart ‚Üª
Note
When you install with
pip install "fastapi[standard]"
it comes with some default optional standard dependencies.
If you don't want to have those optional dependencies, you can instead install
pip install fastapi
.
Advanced User Guide
There is also an
Advanced User Guide
that you can read later after this
Tutorial - User guide
.
The
Advanced User Guide
builds on this one, uses the same concepts, and teaches you some extra features.
But you should first read the
Tutorial - User Guide
(what you are reading right now).
It's designed so that you can build a complete application with just the
Tutorial - User Guide
, and then extend it in different ways, depending on your needs, using some of the additional ideas from the
Advanced User Guide
.
