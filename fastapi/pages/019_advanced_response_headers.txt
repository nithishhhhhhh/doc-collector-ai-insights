Response HeadersÂ¶
=================

Response Headers
Use a
Response
parameter
You can declare a parameter of type
Response
in your
path operation function
(as you can do for cookies).
And then you can set headers in that
temporal
response object.
Python 3.8+
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
,
Response
app
=
FastAPI
()
@app
.
get
(
"/headers-and-object/"
)
def
get_headers
(
response
:
Response
):
response
.
headers
[
"X-Cat-Dog"
]
=
"alone in the world"
return
{
"message"
:
"Hello World"
}
And then you can return any object you need, as you normally would (a
dict
, a database model, etc).
And if you declared a
response_model
, it will still be used to filter and convert the object you returned.
FastAPI
will use that
temporal
response to extract the headers (also cookies and status code), and will put them in the final response that contains the value you returned, filtered by any
response_model
.
You can also declare the
Response
parameter in dependencies, and set headers (and cookies) in them.
Return a
Response
directly
You can also add headers when you return a
Response
directly.
Create a response as described in
Return a Response Directly
and pass the headers as an additional parameter:
Python 3.8+
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
from
fastapi.responses
import
JSONResponse
app
=
FastAPI
()
@app
.
get
(
"/headers/"
)
def
get_headers
():
content
=
{
"message"
:
"Hello World"
}
headers
=
{
"X-Cat-Dog"
:
"alone in the world"
,
"Content-Language"
:
"en-US"
}
return
JSONResponse
(
content
=
content
,
headers
=
headers
)
Technical Details
You could also use
from starlette.responses import Response
or
from starlette.responses import JSONResponse
.
FastAPI
provides the same
starlette.responses
as
fastapi.responses
just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available responses come directly from Starlette.
And as the
Response
can be used frequently to set headers and cookies,
FastAPI
also provides it at
fastapi.Response
.
Custom Headers
Keep in mind that custom proprietary headers can be added
using the 'X-' prefix
.
But if you have custom headers that you want a client in a browser to be able to see, you need to add them to your CORS configurations (read more in
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
), using the parameter
expose_headers
documented in
Starlette's CORS docs
.
