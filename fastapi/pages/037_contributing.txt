Development - Contributing
First, you might want to see the basic ways to
help FastAPI and get help
.
Developing
If you already cloned the
fastapi repository
and you want to deep dive in the code, here are some guidelines to set up your environment.
Virtual environment
Follow the instructions to create and activate a
virtual environment
for the internal code of
fastapi
.
Install requirements using pip
After activating the environment, install the required packages:
fast →
pip install -r requirement
It will install all the dependencies and your local FastAPI in your local environment.
Using your local FastAPI
If you create a Python file that imports and uses FastAPI, and run it with the Python from your local environment, it will use your cloned local FastAPI source code.
And if you update that local FastAPI source code when you run that Python file again, it will use the fresh version of FastAPI you just edited.
That way, you don't have to "install" your local version to be able to test every change.
Technical Details
This only happens when you install using this included
requirements.txt
instead of running
pip install fastapi
directly.
That is because inside the
requirements.txt
file, the local version of FastAPI is marked to be installed in "editable" mode, with the
-e
option.
Format the code
There is a script that you can run that will format and clean all your code:
fast →
bash scripts/format.sh
restart ↻
It will also auto-sort all your imports.
Tests
There is a script that you can run locally to test all the code and generate coverage reports in HTML:
fast →
bash scripts/test-cov-html.sh
restart ↻
This command generates a directory
./htmlcov/
, if you open the file
./htmlcov/index.html
in your browser, you can explore interactively the regions of code that are covered by the tests, and notice if there is any region missing.
Docs
First, make sure you set up your environment as described above, that will install all the requirements.
Docs live
During local development, there is a script that builds the site and checks for any changes, live-reloading:
fast →
python ./scripts/docs.py live
[INFO]
Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8008
[INFO]
Start watching changes
[INFO]
Start detecting changes
restart ↻
It will serve the documentation on
http://127.0.0.1:8008
.
That way, you can edit the documentation/source files and see the changes live.
Tip
Alternatively, you can perform the same steps that scripts does manually.
Go into the language directory, for the main docs in English it's at
docs/en/
:
$
cd
docs/en/
Then run
mkdocs
in that directory:
$
mkdocs
serve
--dev-addr
127
.0.0.1:8008
Typer CLI (optional)
The instructions here show you how to use the script at
./scripts/docs.py
with the
python
program directly.
But you can also use
Typer CLI
, and you will get autocompletion in your terminal for the commands after installing completion.
If you install Typer CLI, you can install completion with:
fast →
typer --install-completion
zsh completion installed in /home/user/.bashrc.
Completion will take effect once you restart the terminal.
restart ↻
Docs Structure
The documentation uses
MkDocs
.
And there are extra tools/scripts in place to handle translations in
./scripts/docs.py
.
Tip
You don't need to see the code in
./scripts/docs.py
, you just use it in the command line.
All the documentation is in Markdown format in the directory
./docs/en/
.
Many of the tutorials have blocks of code.
In most of the cases, these blocks of code are actual complete applications that can be run as is.
In fact, those blocks of code are not written inside the Markdown, they are Python files in the
./docs_src/
directory.
And those Python files are included/injected in the documentation when generating the site.
Docs for tests
Most of the tests actually run against the example source files in the documentation.
This helps to make sure that:
The documentation is up-to-date.
The documentation examples can be run as is.
Most of the features are covered by the documentation, ensured by test coverage.
Apps and docs at the same time
If you run the examples with, e.g.:
fast →
fastapi dev tutorial001.py
INFO
:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
restart ↻
as Uvicorn by default will use the port
8000
, the documentation on port
8008
won't clash.
Translations
Help with translations is VERY MUCH appreciated! And it can't be done without the help from the community. 🌎 🚀
Here are the steps to help with translations.
Tips and guidelines
Check the currently
existing pull requests
for your language. You can filter the pull requests by the ones with the label for your language. For example, for Spanish, the label is
lang-es
.
Review those pull requests, requesting changes or approving them. For the languages I don't speak, I'll wait for several others to review the translation before merging.
Tip
You can
add comments with change suggestions
to existing pull requests.
Check the docs about
adding a pull request review
to approve it or request changes.
Check if there's a
GitHub Discussion
to coordinate translations for your language. You can subscribe to it, and when there's a new pull request to review, an automatic comment will be added to the discussion.
If you translate pages, add a single pull request per page translated. That will make it much easier for others to review it.
To check the 2-letter code for the language you want to translate, you can use the table
List of ISO 639-1 codes
.
Existing language
Let's say you want to translate a page for a language that already has translations for some pages, like Spanish.
In the case of Spanish, the 2-letter code is
es
. So, the directory for Spanish translations is located at
docs/es/
.
Tip
The main ("official") language is English, located at
docs/en/
.
Now run the live server for the docs in Spanish:
fast →
💬 Use the command "live" and pass the language code as a CLI argument
python ./scripts/docs.py live es
[INFO]
Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8008
[INFO]
Start watching changes
[INFO]
Start detecting changes
restart ↻
Tip
Alternatively, you can perform the same steps that scripts does manually.
Go into the language directory, for the Spanish translations it's at
docs/es/
:
$
cd
docs/es/
Then run
mkdocs
in that directory:
$
mkdocs
serve
--dev-addr
127
.0.0.1:8008
Now you can go to
http://127.0.0.1:8008
and see your changes live.
You will see that every language has all the pages. But some pages are not translated and have an info box at the top, about the missing translation.
Now let's say that you want to add a translation for the section
Features
.
Copy the file at:
docs/en/docs/features.md
Paste it in exactly the same location but for the language you want to translate, e.g.:
docs/es/docs/features.md
Tip
Notice that the only change in the path and file name is the language code, from
en
to
es
.
If you go to your browser you will see that now the docs show your new section (the info box at the top is gone). 🎉
Now you can translate it all and see how it looks as you save the file.
Don't Translate these Pages
🚨 Don't translate:
Files under
reference/
release-notes.md
fastapi-people.md
external-links.md
newsletter.md
management-tasks.md
management.md
contributing.md
Some of these files are updated very frequently and a translation would always be behind, or they include the main content from English source files, etc.
New Language
Let's say that you want to add translations for a language that is not yet translated, not even some pages.
Let's say you want to add translations for Creole, and it's not yet there in the docs.
Checking the link from above, the code for "Creole" is
ht
.
The next step is to run the script to generate a new translation directory:
fast →
💬 Use the command new-lang, pass the language code as a CLI argument
python ./scripts/docs.py new-lang ht
Successfully initialized: docs/ht
restart ↻
Now you can check in your code editor the newly created directory
docs/ht/
.
That command created a file
docs/ht/mkdocs.yml
with a simple config that inherits everything from the
en
version:
INHERIT
:
../en/mkdocs.yml
Tip
You could also simply create that file with those contents manually.
That command also created a dummy file
docs/ht/index.md
for the main page, you can start by translating that one.
You can continue with the previous instructions for an "Existing Language" for that process.
You can make the first pull request with those two files,
docs/ht/mkdocs.yml
and
docs/ht/index.md
. 🎉
Preview the result
As already mentioned above, you can use the
./scripts/docs.py
with the
live
command to preview the results (or
mkdocs serve
).
Once you are done, you can also test it all as it would look online, including all the other languages.
To do that, first build all the docs:
fast →
💬 Use the command "build-all", this will take a bit
python ./scripts/docs.py build-all
Building docs for: en
Building docs for: es
Successfully built docs for: es
restart ↻
This builds all those independent MkDocs sites for each language, combines them, and generates the final output at
./site/
.
Then you can serve that with the command
serve
:
fast →
💬 Use the command "serve" after running "build-all"
python ./scripts/docs.py serve
Warning: this is a very simple server. For development, use mkdocs serve instead.
This is here only to preview a site with translations already built.
Make sure you run the build-all command first.
Serving at: http://127.0.0.1:8008

Translation specific tips and guidelines
Translate only the Markdown documents (
.md
). Do not translate the code examples at
./docs_src
.
In code blocks within the Markdown document, translate comments (
# a comment
), but leave the rest unchanged.
Do not change anything enclosed in "``" (inline code).
In lines starting with
///
translate only the text part after
|
. Leave the rest unchanged.
You can translate info boxes like
/// warning
with for example
/// warning | Achtung
. But do not change the word immediately after the
///
, it determines the color of the info box.
Do not change the paths in links to images, code files, Markdown documents.
However, when a Markdown document is translated, the
#hash-parts
in links to its headings may change. Update these links if possible.
Search for such links in the translated document using the regex
#[^# ]
.
Search in all documents already translated into your language for
your-translated-document.md
. For example VS Code has an option "Edit" -> "Find in Files".
When translating a document, do not "pre-translate"
#hash-parts
that link to headings in untranslated documents.
