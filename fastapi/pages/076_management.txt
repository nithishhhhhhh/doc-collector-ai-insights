Repository Management
Here's a short description of how the FastAPI repository is managed and maintained.
Owner
I,
@tiangolo
, am the creator and owner of the FastAPI repository. 🤓
I normally give the final review to each PR before merging them. I make the final decisions on the project, I'm the
BDFL
. 😅
Team
There's a team of people that help manage and maintain the project. 😎
They have different levels of permissions and
specific instructions
.
Some of the tasks they can perform include:
Adding labels to PRs.
Editing PR titles.
Adding commits on top of PRs to tweak them.
Mark answers in GitHub Discussions questions, etc.
Merge some specific types of PRs.
You can see the current team members in
FastAPI People - Team
.
Joining the team is by invitation only, and I could update or remove permissions, instructions, or membership.
FastAPI Experts
The people that help others the most in GitHub Discussions can become

This is normally the best way to contribute to the project.
