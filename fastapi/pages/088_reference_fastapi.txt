A list of tags used by OpenAPI, these are the same
tags
you can set
in the
path operations

@app.get("/users/", tags=["users"])
@app.get("/items/", tags=["items"])
The order of the tags can be used to specify the order shown in
tools like Swagger UI, used in the automatic path
/docs
.
It's not required to specify all the tags used.
The tags that are not declared MAY be organized randomly or based
on the tools' logic. Each tag name in the list MUST be unique.
The value of each item is a
dict
containing:
name
: The name of the tag.
description
: A short description of the tag.
CommonMark syntax
MAY be used for rich
text representation.
externalDocs
: Additional external documentation for this tag. If
provided, it would contain a
dict
with:
description
: A short description of the target documentation.
CommonMark syntax
MAY be used for
rich text representation.
url

servers
A
list
of
dict
s with connectivity information to a target server.
You would use it, for example, if your application is served from
different domains and you want to use the same Swagger UI in the
browser to interact with each of them (instead of having multiple
browser tabs open). Or if you want to leave fixed the possible URLs.
If the servers
list
is not provided, or is an empty
list
, the
default value would be a
dict
with a
url
value of
/
.
Each item in the
list
is a
dict
containing:
url
: A URL to the target host. This URL supports Server Variables
and MAY be relative, to indicate that the host location is relative
to the location where the OpenAPI document is being served. Variable
substitutions will be made when a variable is named in
{
brackets
}
.
description
: An optional string describing the host designated by
the URL.
CommonMark syntax
MAY be used for
rich text representation.
variables
: A
dict
between a variable name and its value. The value
is used for substitution in the server's URL template.

.
TYPE:
Callable
[[
APIRoute

str
]
DEFAULT:
Default
(
generate_unique_id
)
separate_input_output_schemas
Whether to generate separate OpenAPI schemas for request body and
response body when the results would be more precise.
This is particularly useful when automatically generating clients.
For example, if you have a model like:
from
pydantic
import
BaseModel
class
Item
(
BaseModel
):
name
:
str
tags
:
list
[
str
]
=
[]
When
Item
is used for input, a request body,
tags
is not required,
the client doesn't have to provide it.
But when using
Item
for output, for a response body,
tags
is always
available because it has a default value, even if it's just an empty
list. So, the client should be able to always expect it.
In this case, there would be two different schemas, one for input and
another one for output.
TYPE:
bool
DEFAULT:
True
**extra
Extra keyword arguments to be stored in the app, not used by FastAPI
anywhere.
TYPE:
Any
DEFAULT:

PARAMETER
DESCRIPTION
path
The URL path to be used for this
path operation
.
For example, in
http://example.com/items
, the path is
/items
.
TYPE:
str
response_model
The type to use for the response.
It could be any valid Pydantic
field
type. So, it doesn't have to
be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a
list
,
dict
,
etc.
It will be used for:
Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at
/docs
) will
show it as the response (JSON Schema).
Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
response_model
would be used to serialize that object into the
corresponding JSON.
Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
(fields) defined in the
response_model
. If you returned an object
that contains an attribute
password
but the
response_model
does
not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
that
password
.
Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
response_model
, converting any data as necessary to generate the
corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).
Read more about it in the
FastAPI docs for Response Model
.
TYPE:
Any
DEFAULT:
Default
(None)
status_code
The default status code to be used for the response.
You could override the status code by returning a response directly.

FastAPI docs for Response Status Code
.
TYPE:
Optional

description
A description for the
path operation
.
If not provided, it will be extracted automatically from the docstring
of the
path operation function
.
It can contain Markdown.
It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at
/docs
).

/docs
).
TYPE:
Optional
[
bool
]
DEFAULT:
None
operation_id
Custom operation ID to be used by this
path operation
.
By default, it is generated automatically.
If you provide a custom operation ID, you need to make sure it is
unique for the whole API.
You can customize the
operation ID generation with the parameter
generate_unique_id_function
in the
FastAPI
class.
Read more about it in the
FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients
.
TYPE:
Optional
[
str
]
DEFAULT:
None
response_model_include
Configuration passed to Pydantic to include only certain fields in the
response data.
Read more about it in the
FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type
.
TYPE:
Optional
[
IncEx
]
DEFAULT:
None
response_model_exclude
Configuration passed to Pydantic to exclude certain fields in the
response data.
Read more about it in the

.
TYPE:
Optional

]
DEFAULT:
None
response_model_by_alias
Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response model
should be serialized by alias when an alias is used.
Read more about it in the
FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type
.
TYPE:
bool
DEFAULT:
True
response_model_exclude_unset
Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data
should have all the fields, including the ones that were not set and
have their default values. This is different from
response_model_exclude_defaults
in that if the fields are set,
they will be included in the response, even if the value is the same
as the default.
When
True
, default values are omitted from the response.
Read more about it in the
FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type

TYPE:
bool
DEFAULT:
False
response_model_exclude_defaults
Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data
should have all the fields, including the ones that have the same value
as the default. This is different from
response_model_exclude_unset
in that if the fields are set but contain the same default values,
they will be excluded from the response.
When
True
, default values are omitted from the response.

.
TYPE:
bool
DEFAULT:
False
response_model_exclude_none
Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should
exclude fields set to
None
.
This is much simpler (less smart) than
response_model_exclude_unset
and
response_model_exclude_defaults
. You probably want to use one of
those two instead of this one, as those allow returning
None
values
when it makes sense.

The type to use for the response.
It could be any valid Pydantic *field* type. So, it doesn't have to

It will be used for:
* Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
show it as the response (JSON Schema).
* Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
`response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
corresponding JSON.
* Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
(fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
that `password`.
* Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
`response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
(fields) defined in the
response_model
. If you returned an object
that contains an attribute
password
but the
response_model
does
not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
that
password
.
Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
response_model
, converting any data as necessary to generate the
corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

PARAMETER
DESCRIPTION
path
The URL path to be used for this
path operation
.
For example, in
http://example.com/items
, the path is
/items
.
TYPE:
str
response_model
The type to use for the response.
It could be any valid Pydantic
field
type. So, it doesn't have to
be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a
list
,
dict
,
etc.
It will be used for:
Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at
/docs
) will
show it as the response (JSON Schema).
Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
response_model
would be used to serialize that object into the
corresponding JSON.
Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
(fields) defined in the
response_model
. If you returned an object
that contains an attribute
password
but the
response_model
does
not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
that
password
.
Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
response_model
, converting any data as necessary to generate the
corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).
Read more about it in the
FastAPI docs for Response Model
.
TYPE:
Any
DEFAULT:

DEFAULT:
None
operation_id
Custom operation ID to be used by this
path operation
.
By default, it is generated automatically.
If you provide a custom operation ID, you need to make sure it is
unique for the whole API.
You can customize the
operation ID generation with the parameter
generate_unique_id_function
in the
FastAPI
class.

response_model_by_alias
Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response model
should be serialized by alias when an alias is used.
Read more about it in the

.
TYPE:
bool
DEFAULT:
True
response_model_exclude_unset
Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data
should have all the fields, including the ones that were not set and
have their default values. This is different from
response_model_exclude_defaults
in that if the fields are set,
they will be included in the response, even if the value is the same
as the default.
When
True
, default values are omitted from the response.

response_model_exclude_defaults
Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data

in that if the fields are set but contain the same default values,
they will be excluded from the response.
When
True

TYPE:
bool
DEFAULT:
False
response_model_exclude_none
Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should
exclude fields set to
None
.
This is much simpler (less smart) than
response_model_exclude_unset
and
response_model_exclude_defaults
. You probably want to use one of
those two instead of this one, as those allow returning
None
values
when it makes sense.

DESCRIPTION
path
The URL path to be used for this
path operation
.
For example, in
http://example.com/items
, the path is
/items
.
TYPE:
str
response_model
The type to use for the response.
It could be any valid Pydantic
field
type. So, it doesn't have to
be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a
list
,
dict
,
etc.
It will be used for:
Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at
/docs
) will
show it as the response (JSON Schema).
Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
response_model
would be used to serialize that object into the
corresponding JSON.
Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
(fields) defined in the
response_model
. If you returned an object
that contains an attribute
password
but the
response_model
does
not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
that
password
.
Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
response_model
, converting any data as necessary to generate the
corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

FastAPI docs for Response Model

DESCRIPTION
path
The URL path to be used for this
path operation
.
For example, in
http://example.com/items
, the path is
/items
.
TYPE:
str
response_model
The type to use for the response.
It could be any valid Pydantic
field
type. So, it doesn't have to
be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a
list
,
dict
,
etc.
It will be used for:
Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at
/docs
) will
show it as the response (JSON Schema).
Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
response_model
would be used to serialize that object into the
corresponding JSON.
Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
(fields) defined in the
response_model
. If you returned an object
that contains an attribute
password
but the
response_model
does
not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
that
password
.
Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
response_model
, converting any data as necessary to generate the
corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

FastAPI docs for Response Model

The type to use for the response.
It could be any valid Pydantic *field* type. So, it doesn't have to

It will be used for:
* Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
show it as the response (JSON Schema).
* Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
`response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
corresponding JSON.
* Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
(fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
that `password`.
* Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
`response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

The type to use for the response.
It could be any valid Pydantic *field* type. So, it doesn't have to
be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`,
etc.
It will be used for:
* Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
show it as the response (JSON Schema).
* Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
`response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
corresponding JSON.
* Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
(fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
that `password`.
* Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
`response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).
