GraphQL¶
========

GraphQL
As
FastAPI
is based on the
ASGI
standard, it's very easy to integrate any
GraphQL
library also compatible with ASGI.
You can combine normal FastAPI
path operations
with GraphQL on the same application.
Tip
GraphQL
solves some very specific use cases.
It has
advantages
and
disadvantages
when compared to common
web APIs
.
Make sure you evaluate if the
benefits
for your use case compensate the
drawbacks
. 🤓
GraphQL Libraries
Here are some of the
GraphQL
libraries that have
ASGI
support. You could use them with
FastAPI
:
Strawberry
🍓
With
docs for FastAPI
Ariadne
With
docs for FastAPI
Tartiflette
With
Tartiflette ASGI
to provide ASGI integration
Graphene
With
starlette-graphene3
GraphQL with Strawberry
If you need or want to work with
GraphQL
,
Strawberry
is the
recommended
library as it has the design closest to
FastAPI's
design, it's all based on
type annotations
.
Depending on your use case, you might prefer to use a different library, but if you asked me, I would probably suggest you try
Strawberry
.
Here's a small preview of how you could integrate Strawberry with FastAPI:
Python 3.8+
import
strawberry
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
from
strawberry.fastapi
import
GraphQLRouter
@strawberry
.
type
class
User
:
name
:
str
age
:
int
@strawberry
.
type
class
Query
:
@strawberry
.
field
def
user
(
self
)
->
User
:
return
User
(
name
=
"Patrick"
,
age
=
100
)
schema
=
strawberry
.
Schema
(
query
=
Query
)
graphql_app
=
GraphQLRouter
(
schema
)
app
=
FastAPI
()
app
.
include_router
(
graphql_app
,
prefix
=
"/graphql"
)
You can learn more about Strawberry in the
Strawberry documentation
.
And also the docs about
Strawberry with FastAPI
.
Older
GraphQLApp
from Starlette
Previous versions of Starlette included a
GraphQLApp
class to integrate with
Graphene
.
It was deprecated from Starlette, but if you have code that used it, you can easily
migrate
to
starlette-graphene3
, that covers the same use case and has an
almost identical interface
.
Tip
If you need GraphQL, I still would recommend you check out
Strawberry
, as it's based on type annotations instead of custom classes and types.
