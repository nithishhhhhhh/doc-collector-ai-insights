Breaking Changes
♻️ Add support for
pip install "fastapi[standard]"
with standard dependencies and
python -m fastapi
. PR
#11935
by
@tiangolo
.
Summary
Install with:
pip
install
"fastapi[standard]"
Other Changes
This adds support for calling the CLI as:
python
-m
fastapi
And it upgrades
fastapi-cli[standard] >=0.0.5
.
Technical Details
Before this,
fastapi
would include the standard dependencies, with Uvicorn and the
fastapi-cli
, etc.
And
fastapi-slim
would not include those standard dependencies.
Now
fastapi
doesn't include those standard dependencies unless you install with
pip install "fastapi[standard]"
.
Before, you would install
pip install fastapi
, now you should include the
standard
optional dependencies (unless you want to exclude one of those):
pip install "fastapi[standard]"
.
This change is because having the standard optional dependencies installed by default was being inconvenient to several users, and having to install instead
fastapi-slim

Breaking Changes
🐛 Fix unhandled growing memory for internal server errors, refactor dependencies with
yield
and
except
to require raising again as in regular Python. PR
#11191
by
@tiangolo
.
This is a breaking change (and only slightly) if you used dependencies with
yield
, used
except
in those dependencies, and didn't raise again.
This was reported internally by
@rushilsrivastava
as a memory leak when the server had unhandled exceptions that would produce internal server errors, the memory allocated before that point would not be released.
Read the new docs:
Dependencies with
yield
and
except
.
In short, if you had dependencies that looked like:
def
my_dep
():
try
:
yield
except
SomeException
:
pass
Now you need to make sure you raise again after
except
, just as you would in regular Python:
def
my_dep
():
try
:
yield
except
SomeException
:
raise

Breaking Changes
Using resources from dependencies with
yield
in background tasks is no longer supported.
This change is what supports the new features, read below. 🤓
Dependencies with
yield
,
HTTPException
and Background Tasks
Dependencies with
yield
now can raise
HTTPException
and other exceptions after
yield
. 🎉

Before FastAPI 0.106.0, raising exceptions after
yield
was not possible, the exit code in dependencies with
yield
was executed
after
the response was sent, so
Exception Handlers
would have already run.
This was designed this way mainly to allow using the same objects "yielded" by dependencies inside of background tasks, because the exit code would be executed after the background tasks were finished.
Nevertheless, as this would mean waiting for the response to travel through the network while unnecessarily holding a resource in a dependency with yield (for example a database connection), this was changed in FastAPI 0.106.0.
Additionally, a background task is normally an independent set of logic that should be handled separately, with its own resources (e.g. its own database connection).
If you used to rely on this behavior, now you should create the resources for background tasks inside the background task itself, and use internally only data that doesn't depend on the resources of dependencies with
yield
.
For example, instead of using the same database session, you would create a new database session inside of the background task, and you would obtain the objects from the database using this new session. And then instead of passing the object from the database as a parameter to the background task function, you would pass the ID of that object and then obtain the object again inside the background task function.
The sequence of execution before FastAPI 0.106.0 was like this diagram:
Time flows from top to bottom. And each column is one of the parts interacting or executing code.
The new execution flow can be found in the docs:
Execution of dependencies with
yield
.

✨ Support for
Pydantic v2
✨
Pydantic version 2 has the
core
re-written in
Rust
and includes a lot of improvements and features, for example:
Improved
correctness
in corner cases.
Safer
types.
Better
performance
and
less energy
consumption.
Better
extensibility
.
etc.
...all this while keeping the
same Python API
. In most of the cases, for simple models, you can simply upgrade the Pydantic version and get all the benefits. 🚀
In some cases, for pure data validation and processing, you can get performance improvements of
20x
or more. This means 2,000% or more. 🤯
When you use
FastAPI
, there's a lot more going on, processing the request and response, handling dependencies, executing
your own code
, and particularly,
waiting for the network
. But you will probably still get some nice performance improvements just from the upgrade.
The focus of this release is
compatibility
with Pydantic v1 and v2, to make sure your current apps keep working. Later there will be more focus on refactors, correctness, code improvements, and then
performance
improvements. Some third-party early beta testers that ran benchmarks on the beta releases of FastAPI reported improvements of
2x - 3x
. Which is not bad for just doing
pip install --upgrade fastapi pydantic
. This was not an official benchmark and I didn't check it myself, but it's a good sign.
Migration
Check out the
Pydantic migration guide
.
For the things that need changes in your Pydantic models, the Pydantic team built
bump-pydantic
.
A command line tool that will
process your code
and update most of the things
automatically
for you. Make sure you have your code in git first, and review each of the changes to make sure everything is correct before committing the changes.
Pydantic v1
This version of FastAPI still supports Pydantic v1
. And although Pydantic v1 will be deprecated at some point, it will still be supported for a while.
This means that you can install the new Pydantic v2, and if something fails, you can install Pydantic v1 while you fix any problems you might have, but having the latest FastAPI.
There are
tests for both Pydantic v1 and v2
, and test
coverage
is kept at
100%
.
Changes
There are
new parameter
fields supported by Pydantic
Field()
for:
Path()
Query()
Header()
Cookie()
Body()
Form()
File()
The new parameter fields are:
default_factory
alias_priority
validation_alias
serialization_alias
discriminator
strict
multiple_of
allow_inf_nan
max_digits
decimal_places
json_schema_extra
...you can read about them in the Pydantic docs.
The parameter
regex
has been deprecated and replaced by
pattern
.
You can read more about it in the docs for
Query Parameters and String Validations: Add regular expressions
.
New Pydantic models use an improved and simplified attribute
model_config
that takes a simple dict instead of an internal class
Config
for their configuration.
You can read more about it in the docs for
Declare Request Example Data
.
The attribute
schema_extra
for the internal class
Config
has been replaced by the key
json_schema_extra
in the new
model_config
dict.
You can read more about it in the docs for
Declare Request Example Data
.
When you install
"fastapi[all]"
it now also includes:
pydantic-settings
- for settings management.
pydantic-extra-types
- for extra types to be used with Pydantic.
Now Pydantic Settings is an additional optional package (included in
"fastapi[all]"
). To use settings you should now import
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
instead of importing from
pydantic
directly.
You can read more about it in the docs for
Settings and Environment Variables
.

Highlights
This release adds support for dependencies and parameters using
Annotated
and recommends its usage. ✨
This has
several benefits
, one of the main ones is that now the parameters of your functions with
Annotated
would
not be affected
at all.
If you call those functions in
other places in your code
, the actual
default values
will be kept, your editor will help you notice missing
required arguments
, Python will require you to pass required arguments at
runtime
, you will be able to
use the same functions
for different things and with different libraries (e.g.
Typer
will soon support
Annotated
too, then you could use the same function for an API and a CLI), etc.
Because
Annotated
is
standard Python
, you still get all the
benefits
from editors and tools, like
autocompletion
,
inline errors
, etc.
One of the
biggest benefits
is that now you can create
Annotated
dependencies that are then shared by multiple
path operation functions
, this will allow you to
reduce
a lot of
code duplication
in your codebase, while keeping all the support from editors and tools.
For example, you could have code like this:
def
get_current_user
(
token
:
str
):
# authenticate user
return
User
()
@app
.
get
(
"/items/"
)
def
read_items
(
user
:
User
=
Depends
(
get_current_user
)):
...
@app
.
post
(
"/items/"
)
def
create_item
(
*
,
user
:
User
=
Depends
(
get_current_user
),
item
:
Item
):
...
@app
.
get
(
"/items/
{item_id}
"
)
def
read_item
(
*
,
user
:
User
=
Depends
(
get_current_user
),
item_id
:
int
):
...
@app
.
delete
(
"/items/
{item_id}
"
)
def
delete_item
(
*
,
user
:
User
=
Depends
(
get_current_user
),
item_id
:
int
):
...
There's a bit of code duplication for the dependency:
user
:
User
=
Depends
(
get_current_user
)
...the bigger the codebase, the more noticeable it is.
Now you can create an annotated dependency once, like this:
CurrentUser
=
Annotated
[
User
,
Depends
(
get_current_user
)]
And then you can reuse this
Annotated
dependency:
CurrentUser
=
Annotated
[
User
,
Depends
(
get_current_user
)]
@app
.
get
(
"/items/"
)
def
read_items
(
user
:
CurrentUser
):
...
@app
.
post
(
"/items/"
)
def
create_item
(
user
:
CurrentUser
,
item
:
Item
):
...
@app
.
get
(
"/items/
{item_id}
"
)
def
read_item
(
user
:
CurrentUser
,
item_id
:
int
):
...

def
delete_item
(

:
CurrentUser
,

...
...and
CurrentUser
has all the typing information as
User
, so your editor will work as expected (autocompletion and everything), and
FastAPI
will be able to understand the dependency defined in
Annotated
. 😎
Roughly
all the docs
have been rewritten to use
Annotated
as the main way to declare
parameters
and
dependencies
. All the
examples
in the docs now include a version with
Annotated
and a version without it, for each of the specific Python versions (when there are small differences/improvements in more recent versions). There were around 23K new lines added between docs, examples, and tests. 🚀
The key updated docs are:
Python Types Intro:
Type Hints with Metadata Annotations
.
Tutorial:
Query Parameters and String Validations - Additional validation
Advantages of
Annotated
Path Parameters and Numeric Validations - Order the parameters as you need, tricks
Better with
Annotated
Dependencies - First Steps - Share
Annotated
dependencies
Special thanks to
@nzig
for the core implementation and to
@adriangb
for the inspiration and idea with
Xpresso
! 🚀

Features
✨ Add support for
lifespan
async context managers (superseding
startup
and
shutdown
events). Initial PR
#2944
by
@uSpike
.
Now, instead of using independent
startup
and
shutdown
events, you can define that logic in a single function with
yield
decorated with
@asynccontextmanager
(an async context manager).
For example:
from
contextlib
import
asynccontextmanager
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
def
fake_answer_to_everything_ml_model
(
x
:
float
):
return
x
*
42
ml_models
=
{}
@asynccontextmanager
async
def
lifespan
(
app
:
FastAPI
):
# Load the ML model
ml_models
[
"answer_to_everything"
]
=
fake_answer_to_everything_ml_model
yield
# Clean up the ML models and release the resources
ml_models
.
clear
()
app
=
FastAPI
(
lifespan
=
lifespan
)
@app
.
get
(
"/predict"
)
async
def
predict
(
x
:
float
):
result
=
ml_models
[
"answer_to_everything"
](
x
)
return
{
"result"
:
result
}
Note
: This is the recommended way going forward, instead of using
startup
and
shutdown
events.

Upgrades
⬆️ Upgrade Starlette to 0.25.0. PR
#5996
by
@tiangolo
.
This solves a vulnerability that could allow denial of service attacks by using many small multipart fields/files (parts), consuming high CPU and memory.
Only applications using forms (e.g. file uploads) could be affected.
For most cases, upgrading won't have any breaking changes.
0.91.0
Upgrades
⬆️ Upgrade Starlette version to
0.24.0
and refactor internals for compatibility. PR
#5985
by
@tiangolo
.
This can solve nuanced errors when using middlewares. Before Starlette
0.24.0
, a new instance of each middleware class would be created when a new middleware was added. That normally was not a problem, unless the middleware class expected to be created only once, with only one instance, that happened in some cases. This upgrade would solve those cases (thanks
@adriangb
! Starlette PR
#2017
). Now the middleware class instances are created once, right before the first request (the first time the app is called).
If you depended on that previous behavior, you might need to update your code. As always, make sure your tests pass before merging the upgrade.

Features
✨ Add support for function return type annotations to declare the
response_model
. Initial PR
#1436
by
@uriyyo
.
Now you can declare the return type /
response_model
in the function return type annotation:
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
from
pydantic
import
BaseModel
app
=
FastAPI
()
class
Item
(
BaseModel
):
name
:
str
price
:
float
@app
.
get
(
"/items/"
)
async
def
read_items
()
->
list
[
Item
]:
return
[
Item
(
name
=
"Portal Gun"
,
price
=
42.0
),
Item
(
name
=
"Plumbus"
,
price
=
32.0
),
]
FastAPI will use the return type annotation to perform:
Data validation
Automatic documentation
It could power automatic client generators
Data filtering
Before this version it was only supported via the
response_model
parameter.

bump-testclient
.
New
WebSocketException (and docs)
, re-exported from Starlette.
Upgraded and relaxed dependencies for package extras
all
(including new Uvicorn version), when you install
"fastapi[all]"

🐛 Fix
response_model
not invalidating
None
. PR
#2725
by
@hukkin
.
If you are using
response_model
with some type that doesn't include
None
but the function is returning
None
, it will now raise an internal server error, because you are returning invalid data that violates the contract in
response_model
. Before this release it would allow breaking that contract returning
None
.
For example, if you have an app like this:
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
from
pydantic
import
BaseModel
class
Item
(
BaseModel
):
name
:
str
price
:
Optional
[
float
]
=
None
owner_ids
:
Optional
[
List
[
int
]]
=
None
app
=
FastAPI
()
@app
.
get
(
"/items/invalidnone"
,
response_model
=
Item
)
def
get_invalid_none
():
return
None
...calling the path
/items/invalidnone
will raise an error, because
None
is not a valid type for the
response_model
declared with
Item
.
You could also be implicitly returning
None
without realizing, for example:
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
from
pydantic
import
BaseModel
class
Item
(
BaseModel
):
name
:
str
price
:
Optional
[
float
]
=
None
owner_ids
:
Optional
[
List
[
int
]]
=
None
app
=
FastAPI
()
@app
.
get
(
"/items/invalidnone"
,
response_model
=
Item
)
def
get_invalid_none
():
if
flag
:
return
{
"name"
:
"foo"
}
# if flag is False, at this point the function will implicitly return None
If you have
path operations
using
response_model
that need to be allowed to return
None
, make it explicit in
response_model
using
Union[Something, None]
:
from
typing
import
Union
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
from
pydantic
import
BaseModel
class
Item
(
BaseModel
):
name
:
str
price
:
Optional
[
float
]
=
None
owner_ids
:
Optional
[
List
[
int
]]
=
None
app
=
FastAPI
()
@app
.
get
(
"/items/invalidnone"
,
response_model
=
Union
[
Item
,
None
])
def
get_invalid_none
():
return
None
This way the data will be correctly validated, you won't have an internal server error, and the documentation will also reflect that this
path operation
could return
None
(or
null
in JSON).

✨ Add support for omitting
...
as default value when declaring required parameters with:
Path()
Query()
Header()
Cookie()
Body()
Form()
File()
New docs at
Tutorial - Query Parameters and String Validations - Make it required
. PR
#4906
by
@tiangolo
.
Up to now, declaring a required parameter while adding additional validation or metadata needed using
...
(Ellipsis).
For example:
from
fastapi
import
Cookie
,
FastAPI
,
Header
,
Path
,
Query
app
=
FastAPI
()
@app
.
get
(
"/items/
{item_id}
"
)
def
main
(
item_id
:
int
=
Path
(
default
=...
,
gt
=
0
),
query
:
str
=
Query
(
default
=...
,
max_length
=
10
),
session
:
str
=
Cookie
(
default
=...
,
min_length
=
3
),
x_trace
:
str
=
Header
(
default
=...
,
title
=
"Tracing header"
),
):
return
{
"message"
:
"Hello World"
}
...all these parameters are required because the default value is
...
(Ellipsis).
But now it's possible and supported to just omit the default value, as would be done with Pydantic fields, and the parameters would still be required.
✨ For example, this is now supported:
from
fastapi
import
Cookie
,
FastAPI
,
Header
,
Path
,
Query
app
=
FastAPI
()
@app
.
get
(
"/items/
{item_id}
"
)
def
main
(
item_id
:
int
=
Path
(
gt
=
0
),
query
:
str
=
Query
(
max_length
=
10
),
session
:
str
=
Cookie
(
min_length
=
3
),
x_trace
:
str
=
Header
(
title
=
"Tracing header"
),
):
return
{
"message"
:
"Hello World"
}
To declare parameters as optional (not required), you can set a default value as always, for example using
None
:
from
typing
import
Union
from
fastapi
import
Cookie
,
FastAPI
,
Header
,
Path
,
Query
app
=
FastAPI
()
@app
.
get
(
"/items/
{item_id}
"
)
def
main
(
item_id
:
int
=
Path
(
gt
=
0
),
query
:
Union
[
str
,
None
]
=
Query
(
default
=
None
,
max_length
=
10
),
session
:
Union
[
str
,
None
]
=
Cookie
(
default
=
None
,
min_length
=
3
),
x_trace
:
Union
[
str
,
None
]
=
Header
(
default
=
None
,
title
=
"Tracing header"
),
):
return
{
"message"
:
"Hello World"
}

Breaking Changes
✨ Update internal
AsyncExitStack
to fix context for dependencies with
yield
. PR
#4575
by
@tiangolo
.
Dependencies with
yield
can now catch
HTTPException
and custom exceptions. For example:
async
def
get_database
():
with
Session
()
as
session
:
try
:
yield
session
except
HTTPException
:
session
.
rollback
()
raise
finally
:
session
.
close
()
After the dependency with
yield
handles the exception (or not) the exception is raised again. So that any exception handlers can catch it, or ultimately the default internal
ServerErrorMiddleware
.
If you depended on exceptions not being received by dependencies with
yield
, and receiving an exception breaks the code after
yield
, you can use a block with
try
and
finally
:
async
def
do_something
():
try
:
yield
something
finally
:
some_cleanup
()
...that way the
finally
block is run regardless of any exception that might happen.
Features
The same PR
#4575
from above also fixes the
contextvars
context for the code before and after
yield
. This was the main objective of that PR.
This means that now, if you set a value in a context variable before
yield
, the value would still be available after
yield
(as you would intuitively expect). And it also means that you can reset the context variable with a token afterwards.
For example, this works correctly now:
from
contextvars
import
ContextVar
from
typing
import
Any
,
Dict
,
Optional
legacy_request_state_context_var
:
ContextVar
[
Optional
[
Dict
[
str
,
Any
]]]
=
ContextVar
(
"legacy_request_state_context_var"
,
default
=
None
)
async
def
set_up_request_state_dependency
():
request_state
=
{
"user"
:
"deadpond"
}
contextvar_token
=
legacy_request_state_context_var
.
set
(
request_state
)
yield
request_state
legacy_request_state_context_var
.
reset
(
contextvar_token
)
...before this change it would raise an error when resetting the context variable, because the
contextvars
context was different, because of the way it was implemented.
Note
: You probably don't need
contextvars
, and you should probably avoid using them. But they are powerful and useful in some advanced scenarios, for example, migrating from code that used Flask's
g
semi-global variable.

0.70.0
This release just upgrades Starlette to the latest version,
0.16.0
, which includes several bug fixes and some small breaking changes.
These last
three consecutive releases
are independent so that you can
migrate gradually
:
First to FastAPI
0.68.2
, with no breaking changes, but upgrading all the sub-dependencies.
Next to FastAPI
0.69.0
, which upgrades Starlette to
0.15.0
, with AnyIO support, and a higher chance of having breaking changes in your code.
Finally to FastAPI
0.70.0
, just upgrading Starlette to the latest version
0.16.0
with additional bug fixes.
This way, in case there was a breaking change for your code in one of the releases, you can still benefit from the previous upgrades. ✨
Breaking Changes - Upgrade
⬆️ Upgrade Starlette to 0.16.0. PR
#4016
by
@tiangolo
.
Also upgrades the ranges of optional dependencies:
"jinja2 >=2.11.2,<4.0.0"
"itsdangerous >=1.1.0,<3.0.0"
0.69.0
Breaking Changes - Upgrade
This release adds support for
Trio
. ✨
It upgrades the version of Starlette to
0.15.0
, now based on
AnyIO
, and the internal async components in
FastAPI
are now based on AnyIO as well, making it compatible with both
asyncio
and
Trio
.
You can read the docs about running
FastAPI with Trio using Hypercorn
.
This release also removes
graphene
as an optional dependency for GraphQL. If you need to work with GraphQL, the recommended library now is
Strawberry
. You can read the new
FastAPI with GraphQL docs
.

0.68.2
This release has
no breaking changes
. 🎉
It upgrades the version ranges of sub-dependencies to allow applications using FastAPI to easily upgrade them.
Soon there will be a new FastAPI release upgrading Starlette to take advantage of recent improvements, but as that has a higher chance of having breaking changes, it will be in a separate release.

Security fixes
🔒 Check Content-Type request header before assuming JSON. Initial PR
#2118
by
@patrickkwang
.
This change fixes a
CSRF
security vulnerability when using cookies for authentication in path operations with JSON payloads sent by browsers.
In versions lower than
0.65.2
, FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the
content-type
header sent was not set to
application/json
or a compatible JSON media type (e.g.
application/geo+json
).
So, a request with a content type of
text/plain
containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted.
But requests with content type
text/plain
are exempt from
CORS
preflights, for being considered
Simple requests
. So, the browser would execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application.
See
CVE-2021-32677
for more details.

Features
✨ Add support for shared/top-level parameters (dependencies, tags, etc). PR
#2434
by
@tiangolo
.
Up to now, for several options, the only way to apply them to a group of
path operations
was in
include_router
. That works well, but the call to
app.include_router()
or
router.include_router()
is normally done in another file.
That means that, for example, to apply authentication to all the
path operations
in a router it would end up being done in a different file, instead of keeping related logic together.
Setting options in
include_router
still makes sense in some cases, for example, to override or increase configurations from a third party router included in an app. But in a router that is part of a bigger application, it would probably make more sense to add those settings when creating the
APIRouter
.
In
FastAPI
This allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters):
default_response_class
: updated to handle defaults in
APIRouter
and
include_router
.
dependencies
: to include ✨ top-level dependencies ✨ that apply to the whole application. E.g. to add global authentication.
callbacks
: OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the
path operations
.
deprecated
: to mark all the
path operations
as deprecated. 🤷
include_in_schema
: to allow excluding all the
path operations
from the OpenAPI schema.
responses
: OpenAPI responses that apply to all the
path operations
.
For example:
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
,
Depends
async
def
some_dependency
():
return
app
=
FastAPI
(
dependencies
=
[
Depends
(
some_dependency
)])
In
APIRouter
This allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters):
default_response_class
: updated to handle defaults in
APIRouter
and
include_router
. For example, it's not needed to set it explicitly when
creating callbacks
.
dependencies
: to include ✨ router-level dependencies ✨ that apply to all the
path operations
in a router. Up to now, this was only possible with
include_router
.
callbacks
: OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the
path operations
in this router.
deprecated
: to mark all the
path operations
in a router as deprecated.
include_in_schema
: to allow excluding all the
path operations
in a router from the OpenAPI schema.
responses
: OpenAPI responses that apply to all the
path operations
in a router.
prefix
: to set the path prefix for a router. Up to now, this was only possible when calling
include_router
.
tags
: OpenAPI tags to apply to all the
path operations
in this router.
For example:
from
fastapi
import
APIRouter
,
Depends
async
def
some_dependency
():
return
router
=
APIRouter
(
prefix
=
"/users"
,
dependencies
=
[
Depends
(
some_dependency
)])
In
include_router
Most of these settings are now supported in
APIRouter
, which normally lives closer to the related code, so it is recommended to use
APIRouter
when possible.
But
include_router
is still useful to, for example, adding options (like
dependencies
,
prefix
, and
tags
) when including a third party router, or a generic router that is shared between several projects.
This PR allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters):
default_response_class
: updated to handle defaults in
APIRouter
and
FastAPI
.
deprecated
: to mark all the
path operations
in a router as deprecated in OpenAPI.
include_in_schema
: to allow disabling all the
path operations
from showing in the OpenAPI schema.
callbacks
: OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the
path operations
in this router.
Note: all the previous parameters are still there, so it's still possible to declare
dependencies
in
include_router
.
Breaking Changes
PR
#2434
includes several improvements that shouldn't affect normal use cases, but could affect in advanced scenarios:
If you are testing the generated OpenAPI (you shouldn't, FastAPI already tests it extensively for you): the order for
tags
in
include_router
and
path operations
was updated for consistency, but it's a simple order change.
If you have advanced custom logic to access each route's
route.response_class
, or the
router.default_response_class
, or the
app.default_response_class
: the default value for
response_class
in
APIRoute
and for
default_response_class
in
APIRouter
and
FastAPI
is now a
DefaultPlaceholder
used internally to handle and solve default values and overrides. The actual response class inside the
DefaultPlaceholder
is available at
route.response_class.value
.

Breaking Changes
Require Pydantic >
1.0.0
.
Remove support for deprecated Pydantic
0.32.2
. This improves maintainability and allows new features.
In
FastAPI
and
APIRouter
:
Remove
path operation decorators
related/deprecated parameter
response_model_skip_defaults
(use
response_model_exclude_unset
instead).
Change
path operation decorators
parameter default for
response_model_exclude
from
set()
to
None
(as is in Pydantic).
In
encoders.jsonable_encoder
:
Remove deprecated
skip_defaults
, use instead
exclude_unset
.
Set default of
exclude
from
set()
to
None
(as is in Pydantic).
PR
#1862
.
In
encoders.jsonable_encoder
remove parameter
sqlalchemy_safe

It was an early hack to allow returning SQLAlchemy models, but it was never documented, and the recommended way is using Pydantic's
orm_mode
as described in the tutorial:
SQL (Relational) Databases

Raise an exception when using form data (
Form

File
) without having
python-multipart
installed.
Up to now the application would run, and raise an exception only when receiving a request with form data, the new behavior, raising early, will prevent from deploying applications with broken dependencies.
It also detects if the correct package
python-multipart
is installed instead of the incorrect
multipart
(both importable as
multipart
).

Response

status

0.42.0
Add dependencies with
yield
, a.k.a. exit steps, context managers, cleanup, teardown, ...
This allows adding extra code after a dependency is done. It can be used, for example, to close database connections.
Dependencies with
yield
can be normal or
async
,
FastAPI
will run normal dependencies in a threadpool.
They can be combined with normal dependencies.
It's possible to have arbitrary trees/levels of dependencies with
yield
and exit steps are handled in the correct order automatically.
It works by default in Python 3.7 or above. For Python 3.6, it requires the extra backport dependencies:
async-exit-stack
async-generator

Improve handling of custom classes for
Request
s and
APIRoute
s.
This helps to more easily solve use cases like:
Reading a body before and/or after a request (equivalent to a middleware).
Run middleware-like code only for a subset of
path operations
.
Process a request before passing it to a
path operation function
. E.g. decompressing, deserializing, etc.
Processing a response after being generated by
path operation functions
but before returning it. E.g. adding custom headers, logging, adding extra metadata.

) and discard them instead of raising an error.
This allows declaring a parameter like
user_id: str = None

path operation
can be included in a router with a path
/users/{user_id}
, in which case will be taken from the path and will be required.

Fix OpenAPI/JSON Schema generation for two functions with the same name (in different modules) with the same composite bodies.
Composite bodies' IDs are now based on path, not only on route name, as the auto-generated name uses the function names, that can be duplicated in different modules.
The same new ID generation applies to response models.
This also changes the generated title for those models.
Only composite bodies and response models are affected because those are generated dynamically, they don't have a module (a Python file).
This also adds the possibility of using
.include_router()
with the same
APIRouter
multiple
times, with different prefixes, e.g.
/api/v2
and
/api/latest
, and it will now work correctly.

Add support for Pydantic's ORM mode:
Updated documentation about SQL with SQLAlchemy, using Pydantic models with ORM mode, SQLAlchemy models with relations, separation of files, simplification of code and other changes. New docs:
SQL (Relational) Databases
.
The new support for ORM mode fixes issues/adds features related to ORMs with lazy-loading, hybrid properties, dynamic/getters (using
@property
decorators) and several other use cases.
This applies to ORMs like SQLAlchemy, Peewee, Tortoise ORM, GINO ORM and virtually any other.
If your
path operations
return an arbitrary object with attributes (e.g.
my_item.name
instead of
my_item["name"]
) AND you use a
response_model
, make sure to update the Pydantic models with
orm_mode = True
as described in the docs (link above).
New documentation about receiving plain
dict
s as request bodies:
Bodies of arbitrary
dict
s
.
New documentation about returning arbitrary
dict
s in responses:
Response with arbitrary
dict
.
Technical Details
:
When declaring a
response_model
it is used directly to generate the response content, from whatever was returned from the
path operation function
.
Before this, the return content was first passed through
jsonable_encoder
to ensure it was a "jsonable" object, like a
dict
, instead of an arbitrary object with attributes (like an ORM model). That's why you should make sure to update your Pydantic models for objects with attributes to use
orm_mode = True
.
If you don't have a
response_model
, the return object will still be passed through
jsonable_encoder
first.
When a
response_model
is declared, the same
response_model
type declaration won't be used as is, it will be "cloned" to create an new one (a cloned Pydantic
Field
with all the submodels cloned as well).
This avoids/fixes a potential security issue: as the returned object is passed directly to Pydantic, if the returned object was a subclass of the
response_model
(e.g. you return a
UserInDB
that inherits from
User
but contains extra fields, like
hashed_password
, and
User
is used in the
response_model
), it would still pass the validation (because
UserInDB
is a subclass of
User
) and the object would be returned as-is, including the
hashed_password
. To fix this, the declared
response_model
is cloned, if it is a Pydantic model class (or contains Pydantic model classes in it, e.g. in a
List[Item]
), the Pydantic model class(es) will be a different one (the "cloned" one). So, an object that is a subclass won't simply pass the validation and returned as-is, because it is no longer a sub-class of the cloned
response_model
. Instead, a new Pydantic model object will be created with the contents of the returned object. So, it will be a new object (made with the data from the returned one), and will be filtered by the cloned
response_model
, containing only the declared fields as normally.

Implement dependency cache per request.
This avoids calling each dependency multiple times for the same request.
This is useful while calling external services, performing costly computation, etc.
This also means that if a dependency was declared as a
path operation decorator
dependency, possibly at the router level (with
.include_router()
) and then it is declared again in a specific
path operation
, the dependency will be called only once.
The cache can be disabled per dependency declaration, using
use_cache=False
as in
Depends(your_dependency, use_cache=False)
.

Add OAuth2 redirect page for Swagger UI. This allows having delegated authentication in the Swagger UI docs. For this to work, you need to add
{your_origin}/docs/oauth2-redirect
to the allowed callbacks in your OAuth2 provider (in Auth0, Facebook, Google, etc).
For example, during development, it could be
http://localhost:8000/docs/oauth2-redirect
.
Keep in mind that this callback URL is independent of whichever one is used by your frontend. You might also have another callback at
https://yourdomain.com/login/callback

parameter:

This is useful, for example, to require authentication or permissions in specific group of

.

dependencies
can be applied to different routers.
These
dependencies
are run before the normal parameter dependencies. And normal dependencies are run too. They can be combined.
Dependencies declared in a router are executed first, then the ones defined in
path operation decorators
, and then the ones declared in normal parameters. They are all combined and executed.

parameters, for more advanced OAuth 2.0 security scenarios with scopes.
