Environment Variables¶
======================

Environment Variables
Tip
If you already know what "environment variables" are and how to use them, feel free to skip this.
An environment variable (also known as "
env var
") is a variable that lives
outside
of the Python code, in the
operating system
, and could be read by your Python code (or by other programs as well).
Environment variables could be useful for handling application
settings
, as part of the
installation
of Python, etc.
Create and Use Env Vars
You can
create
and use environment variables in the
shell (terminal)
, without needing Python:
Linux, macOS, Windows Bash
Windows PowerShell
fast →
💬 You could create an env var MY_NAME with
export MY_NAME="Wade Wilso
fast →
💬 Create an env var MY_NAME
$Env:MY_NAME = "Wade Wilso
Read env vars in Python
You could also create environment variables
outside
of Python, in the terminal (or with any other method), and then
read them in Python
.
For example you could have a file
main.py
with:
import
os
name
=
os
.
getenv
(
"MY_NAME"
,
"World"
)
print
(
f
"Hello
{
name
}
from Python"
)
Tip
The second argument to
os.getenv()
is the default value to return.
If not provided, it's
None
by default, here we provide
"World"
as the default value to use.
Then you could call that Python program:
Linux, macOS, Windows Bash
Windows PowerShell
fast →
💬 Here we don't set the env var yet
python main.py
💬 As we didn't set the env var, we get the default value
Hello World from Python
💬 But if we create an environment variable first
export MY_NAME="Wade Wilson"
💬 And then call the program again
python main.py
💬 Now it can read the environment variable
Hello Wade Wilson from Python
restart ↻
fast →
💬 Here we don't set the env var yet
python main.py
💬 As we didn't set the env var, we get the default value
Hello World from Python
💬 But if we create an environment variable first
$
As environment variables can be set outside of the code, but can be read by the code, and don't have to be stored (committed to
git
) with the rest of the files, it's common to use them for configurations or
settings
.
You can also create an environment variable only for a
specific program invocation
, that is only available to that program, and only for its duration.
To do that, create it right before the program itself, on the same line:
fast →
💬 Create an env var MY_NAME in line for this program call
MY_NAME="Wade Wilson" python main.py
💬 Now it can read the environment variable
Hello Wade Wilson from Python
💬 The env var no longer exists afterwards
python main.py
Hello World from Python
restart ↻

You can read more about it at
The Twelve-Factor App: Config
.
Types and Validation
These environment variables can only handle
text strings
, as they are external to Python and have to be compatible with other programs and the rest of the system (and even with different operating systems, as Linux, Windows, macOS).
That means that
any value
read in Python from an environment variable
will be a
str
, and any conversion to a different type or any validation has to be done in code.
You will learn more about using environment variables for handling
application settings
in the
Advanced User Guide - Settings and Environment Variables
.
PATH
Environment Variable
There is a
special
environment variable called
PATH
that is used by the operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) to find programs to run.
The value of the variable
PATH
is a long string that is made of directories separated by a colon
:
on Linux and macOS, and by a semicolon
;
on Windows.
For example, the
PATH
environment variable could look like this:
Linux, macOS
Windows
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
This means that the system should look for programs in the directories:
/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin
C:\Program Files\Python312\Scripts;C:\Program Files\Python312;C:\Windows\System32
This means that the system should look for programs in the directories:
C:\Program Files\Python312\Scripts
C:\Program Files\Python312
C:\Windows\System32
When you type a
command
in the terminal, the operating system
looks for
the program in
each of those directories
listed in the
PATH
environment variable.
For example, when you type
python
in the terminal, the operating system looks for a program called
python
in the
first directory
in that list.
If it finds it, then it will
use it
. Otherwise it keeps looking in the
other directories
.
Installing Python and Updating the
PATH
When you install Python, you might be asked if you want to update the
PATH
environment variable.
Linux, macOS
Windows
Let's say you install Python and it ends up in a directory
/opt/custompython/bin
.
If you say yes to update the
PATH
environment variable, then the installer will add
/opt/custompython/bin
to the
PATH
environment variable.
It could look like this:
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/custompython/bin
This way, when you type
python
in the terminal, the system will find the Python program in
/opt/custompython/bin
(the last directory) and use that one.
Let's say you install Python and it ends up in a directory
C:\opt\custompython\bin
.
If you say yes to update the
PATH
environment variable, then the installer will add
C:\opt\custompython\bin
to the
PATH
environment variable.
C:\Program Files\Python312\Scripts;C:\Program Files\Python312;C:\Windows\System32;C:\opt\custompython\bin
This way, when you type
python
in the terminal, the system will find the Python program in
C:\opt\custompython\bin
(the last directory) and use that one.
So, if you type:
fast →
python
restart ↻
Linux, macOS
Windows
The system will
find
the
python
program in
/opt/custompython/bin
and run it.
It would be roughly equivalent to typing:
fast →
/opt/custompython/bin/python
restart ↻
The system will
find
the
python
program in
C:\opt\custompython\bin\python
and run it.
It would be roughly equivalent to typing:
fast →
C:\opt\custompython\bin\py
This information will be useful when learning about
Virtual Environments
.
Conclusion
With this you should have a basic understanding of what
environment variables
are and how to use them in Python.
You can also read more about them in the
Wikipedia for Environment Variable
.
In many cases it's not very obvious how environment variables would be useful and applicable right away. But they keep showing up in many different scenarios when you are developing, so it's good to know about them.
For example, you will need this information in the next section, about
Virtual Environments
.
