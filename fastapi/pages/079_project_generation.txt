Full Stack FastAPI Template
Templates, while typically come with a specific setup, are designed to be flexible and customizable. This allows you to modify and adapt them to your project's requirements, making them an excellent starting point. 🏁
You can use this template to get started, as it includes a lot of the initial set up, security, database and some API endpoints already done for you.
