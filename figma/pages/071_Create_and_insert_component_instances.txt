Components are UI elements that you can reuse across your designs.
The
main component
defines the properties of the element.
The
instance
is a copy of the component you can reuse in your designs.
There are a few ways to create and insert component instances into your designs:
From the
assets panel
in the left sidebar
From the
component details modal
, accessible from the assets panel
Using the asset tab of the
actions menu
copying or duplicating
an instance
Tip:
You can handoff component instances for development without reorganizing your file by
marking instances as ready for dev in Dev Mode →
Assets panel
The
Assets
panel in the left sidebar allows you to search for components to add to your file. You can choose which libraries are available in the
