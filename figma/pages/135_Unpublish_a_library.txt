Who can use this feature
Available on

Team admins or anyone with can edit access to the file can unpublish a published library.
New to component libraries? Check out our
Guide to components
and
Guide to libraries
articles.
If you maintain a library of styles, components, and variables, you may need to unpublish a library. This means anyone using this library will no longer be able to access the library or receive updates to its styles, components, and variables.
Open the file that you want to unpublish. Make sure you select the library file where your main components and styles are located.
Go to the
Assets
tab and click the
Library
icon. The tooltip may read
Review library updates
if there are updates to libraries you are using in the file, or
Review unpublished changes
if you have unpublished updates in your file.
Select the
This file
section and click on the current file to view the styles, components, and variable collections in the library.
Click the
Unpublish
button at the bottom of the modal.
Click
Remove File from Library
to confirm. Figma will remove that file and any styles and components from the library modal.
Note:
Team members can still use instances from an unpublished library. They will no longer receive any updates made to those instances.
