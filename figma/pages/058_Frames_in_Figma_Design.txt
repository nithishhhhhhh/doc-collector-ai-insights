==================================================

Before you start
Who can use this feature
Available on
all plans
Anyone with
can edit
access to a file can create and edit frames
Frames are layers that act as containers to organize other layers—such as shapes, images, and text—into cohesive designs. You can even nest frames within other frames, allowing you to create more complex designs. Frames allow you to build everything from individual elements like icons or buttons, to entire website layouts and mobile app designs.
Frames that sit directly on the canvas are called
top-level frames
. Frames that contain other layers are called
parent
objects. Any layers or nested frames inside a parent frame are called
child
objects. Learn more about
the parent, child, and sibling relationship
Similar to other layer types, you can
adjust the properties of a frame
including its dimensions and fill.
Frames also give you access to other features including
layout guides
auto layout
constraints
, and
prototyping
You can identify frames in the
Layers
panel of the left sidebar by the
frame icon.
Select the frame tool
Enable the
Frame tool by selecting it in the toolbar, or by using one of the keyboard shortcuts:
Create a frame
Once the
Frame
tool is selected, there are several ways to create frames:
Click on the canvas
Use a frame preset
Duplicate an existing frame
Click on the canvas
With the
Frame
tool selected, do one of the following:
Click on the canvas to create a top-level frame. If this is the first top-level frame you’re creating during your current session in this file, the frame’s dimensions will be set to 100 x 100. Otherwise, the top level-frame will use the same dimensions of the last top-level frame you created.
Click inside an existing frame to add a 100 x 100 nested frame.
Click and drag on the canvas or in an existing frame to add a frame with custom dimensions.
Tip:
You can also create a frame around existing objects using Frame selection. Select one or more layers, then use the frame selection keyboard shortcut:
Mac
⌥ Option
⌘ Command
Windows
Ctrl
Alt
Use a frame preset
When the
Frame
tool is enabled, a list of frame presets become available in right sidebar. Click the arrow to expand the section and select a preset from the list. You can choose presets for popular device and asset templates:
Phone
Tablet
Desktop
Presentation
Watch
Paper
Social Media
Figma Community
Archive
If you want to change a frame to a different preset, select the frame and use the
Frame
dropdown in the right sidebar to select a different frame preset.
Duplicate an existing frame
There are two ways to duplicate an existing frame:
Quick-add
: With the
Frame
tool enabled, hover over an existing frame and pressing the +
plus
on either side of the frame. This will duplicate the frame and nudge other frames over to accommodate the new frame.
Duplication shortcut
: Select a frame and use the duplication keyboard shortcut
⌘ Command
(Mac) /
⌃ Control
(Windows). You don’t need to enable the
Frame
tool to use this method. Learn more about
duplicating options
For both methods, if your frame is in a section, the section will resize to accommodate the new frame.
You can also quickly create a blank frame of the same size by clicking the +
plus
on either side of the frame while holding the keyboard modifier:
Mac:
⌥ Option
Windows:
Alt
Frame properties
There are a few properties associated with frames. Frames support the following properties.
Corner Radius
: Round the corner of a frame to create softer edges.
Clip Content
: Hide any objects within the frame that extend beyond the frame's bounds.
Layout Guides
: Create guidelines to help with the visual structure to your designs.
Auto Layout:
Create dynamic frames that respond to their contents
Fill
: Apply a solid fill, gradient,
images
(PNG, JPEG, GIF, TIFF and WEBP) to a frame.
Stroke
: Add strokes to a frame to create a border or outline
Effects
: Add a shadow or blurs to a frame
Extra functionality
Frames allow you to access extra functionality in Figma. You will need to use frames to use the following features or functions:
Layout Guides
: Apply transparent uniform grids, columns, and/or rows to frames to provide visual structure
Constraints
: Define how child objects respond when you resize a frame. Apply constraints to
objects
within a frame.
Auto Layout
: Add Auto layout to frames to create dynamic layouts that respond to their contents
Prototyping
: Create interactive prototypes that move between frames in your canvas
A frame is a
parent
object. This means that it can control or influence any
child
objects you place within it.
Learn more about parent/child relationships in Figma.
Tip:
You can hand off frames for development without reorganizing your file.
Create a section for your frame
, or convert the frame to a section. Then,
mark the section as
Ready for dev
Adjust properties of the frame
In the past, it was possible to adjust the properties of child objects when you selected the frame. Now, you can adjust the properties of the frame itself.
Select a child object by using the keyboard shortcut:
Enter
Return
Press the
Tab
key to select the next sibling.
Press
Shift
Tab
to select the previous sibling.
Press
Shift
Enter
to select the parent
If you want to adjust the fill and stroke properties of a frame and it's children, you can use
Selection colors
view or adjust colors in a mixed selection
Nest frames within other frames
In Figma, you can create frames within other frames. We call this process nesting. This allows you to combine frames with different properties to build complex interfaces.
This creates new hierarchies or relationships:
Top-level frames:
Any frame that is directly on the canvas. For a frame to be a top-level frame, you can't nest it within another frame, group, or object
Nested frame
: Any frame that is placed within another frame. You can place frames within top-level frames, or within other nested frames. Nested frames are both a parent and a child
Children:
Any object that is within a frame
Learn more about parent, child, and sibling relationships.
Top-level frames
Figma
bolds
top-level frames in the layers panel and shows the name of any top-level frames on the canvas.
Nested frames
Nested frames are frames that you place within another frame or object. This makes them both a parent and a child. You can place frames within:
Top-level frames
Other nested frames
In groups
In our example below, each of our elements are in their own frame. We have a status bar at the top and a navigation menu at the bottom. We also have a card that includes the details of our Upcoming Tickets.
Using one of our device presets, we can create a top-level frame for our elements. We can add our elements to the top-level frame to build a single screen in our mobile app.
Resize frames
You can interact with frames like any other object on the canvas, including change the size or scale of frames. There are a few ways to change the size of a Frame:
Drag the frame
Drag to resize a frame manually.
Select the frame in the canvas, or layers panel in the left sidebar.
Click the handle in one of the corners and drag to resize. Or, click one of the edges and drag.
Tip!
To ignore any
constraints
on child objects, hold down the modifier key:
Mac:
⌘ Command
Windows:
Ctrl
Change the frame preset
Select another frame preset to change the frame's size.
Select the frame.
In the Properties Panel in the right sidebar, select the frame field.
Select a preset from the list.
Choose presets for popular device and assets templates:

Figma will update your frame's dimensions to match the preset.
Note:
If you have applied
constraints
to any child objects, Figma will resize them to match the new frame preset. Otherwise, objects inside the frame will stay at the original dimensions and position.
Properties Panel
Update the Frame's
Width
and
Height
using the right sidebar.
Enter a new number in the
and
fields, or hover over the icon to scrub the field. Drag left to decrease and right to increase.
Select <icon> Lock aspect ratio next to the
idth and
eight fields to maintain the layer’s proportions while resizing it.
Tip:
You can use the dimension fields to perform calculations. This allows you to quickly scale or resize objects.
Percentage, such as 50%
Add, such as +100
Subtract, such as -20
Multiply, such as *4
Divide, such as /8
It's not possible to
multiply
a width or height by a
percentage
, for example *50% will result in a value 50x the original, not 50%.
Resize to fit
You can resize a frame so that it shrinks or grows to fit its child objects. This will redraw the frame around the outermost bounds of the objects within it.
Use the keyboard shortcut:
Mac:
⌥ Option
Shift
⌘ Command
Windows:
Alt
Shift
Control
Click
in the
Layout
section of the right sidebar
Ungroup a frame
To ungroup a frame, select the frame and press:
Mac:
⌘ Command
Shift
⌘ Command
Delete
Windows:
Control
Shift
Control
Backspace
