Font fallback
Font fallback allows you to use characters and icons that aren't specifically supported by that font.
If a font doesn't support a character you input, Figma will render that specific character in a Noto font. No more empty spaces or missing character icons.
For people writing in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, Figma may choose the wrong version of a character.
To fix that, you can select your text and update the font to use the specific Noto font for your language. Or select another font that supports the language you’re writing in.
