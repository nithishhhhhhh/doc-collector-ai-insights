A Guide to Developer Handoff
While handing off designs to developers frequently happens after a major project milestone, here are some things you can do earlier in the design process to set up your files to improve handoff.
Set up files for Collaboration
There are lots of different ways to collaborate in Figma. We've rounded up a few tips that we've used ourselves, or seen in action.
Files
Right-click any frame and
set a custom thumbnail
so you can identify files at a glance. The thumbnail can also include information such as the project's current status.
Link to Figma Design files
in your project specification documents or project plans.
Create "sticky note" components
and add them to the canvas to explain or draw attention to design decisions.
Apply Export Settings
to frames, Components and Assets your Developers may need to export for the final production build.
Pages
Name pages
descriptively to let others know what's ready for development.
Create a single page with Instances of all your components. Collaborators only have to check this page, as you make changes to your components.
Right-click on a component and choose
Move to Page
or check out the
Component Page
plugin.
Sections
Organize files with sections
for easier navigation.
Mark content as “Ready for development” to help with developer handoff.
Styles and components
Give
Styles
relevant and descriptive names.
Add component documentation to your design system. Collaborators can use
Go to Main Component
to learn more about how to use it.
Name layers and components based on their IDs
Add meaningful descriptions to components
When and how collaborators can use them
Any variants or states
Accessibility and contrast guidance

Invite collaborators to files and prototypes
You can invite collaborators to a prototype, or to the file itself.
Share a prototype
Invite a collaborator to a file
When inviting someone to a file, you can choose to give them
can view
can edit
access. In most situations, inviting a collaborator with
can view
access will be enough.
Users with view access can:
Select layers from the Layers panel or canvas
View properties of selected layers in the Inspect panel
Copy text content from Text objects
Measure distances between objects in the canvas
Add or reply to comments in files and prototypes
View Prototypes in Presentation View
Access components via the Go to Main Component link
Link Dev resources to layers in Dev Mode
Note:
You have the option to
allow users with view access to copy and share
the contents of a file. If you enable this, those with view access will not be able to explore or export assets from a file.
