Before you Start
Who can use this feature
Available on
plan
Anyone with
can edit
access to a file can edit vector layers
Vector edit mode lets you select, adjust, and change the properties of vector layers,
including
basic shapes
and custom vector networks drawn with the
Pen
Brush
, or
Pencil
tools
Enter vector edit mode
To enter vector edit mode, select one or more vector layers and press
Enter
. While in vector edit mode, you’ll be able to see and interact with the existing points and paths of the vector layer. You’ll also have access to the following vector editing tools in the secondary toolbar:
Lasso
Shape builder
Paint
Bend
Edit vector networks
While in vector edit mode, you can interact with the existing points and paths of a vector network:
Move points:
To move an existing point, select the
Move
tool in the secondary toolbar or press
. Then, click and drag a point to reposition it on the canvas.
Add points
: To add additional points, select the
Pen
tool in the toolbar or press
. Then, click along the vector network’s path to start adding additional points.
Edit multiple vector layers:
You can edit multiple vector layers at once by pressing
Shift
and clicking on a layer to add it to your current selection.
Switch vector layers:
To change to a different vector layer outside your current selection, press the modifier key and click on the layer:

Create curved paths with bézier handles
The Bend tool allows you to add bézier handles to create a curve in a path.
To add bézier handles to a vector network:
Select the
Bend
tool in the secondary toolbar.
Click on a point or path where you want to add a curve.
Use the bézier handles to adjust the length and slope of the curve.
Tip
: We recommend checking out
The Bezier Game
to practice using the Pen tool and mastering bézier curves.
Handle mirroring options
You can use the Mirroring settings to specify how a set of bézier handles mirror each other:
No mirroring:
Each handle can be moved independently
Mirror angle:
The unselected handle will mirror the angle of the selected handle
Mirror angle and length
: The unselected handle will mirror the angle and length of the selected handle
Note:
To move both handles in the same direction, press
Shift
and select each handle, then click and drag one handle to adjust its position. The other handle will copy the movement.
Select points and paths with the Lasso tool
You can select specific points and paths inside a vector network using the Lasso tool.
Select the
Lasso
tool from the secondary toolbar or press
Click and drag to draw a shape around the points and paths you want to select. You can then manipulate the selected points, or delete them from the vector network.
Add fills to closed regions
You can add fills to any closed regions of a vector network. If there are multiple closed regions within a vector network, you can adjust the fill of each region individually.
To add a fill to a closed region:
Select the
Paint
tool from the secondary toolbar or press
Shift
Hover over the region of the vector network you want to add a fill to. A pattern of diagonal stripes indicates which region is currently selected.
The cursor will change to a droplet icon with a:
plus if you can add a fill to that region
minus if there is an existing fill that you can remove
Click to add or remove a fill to the shape or region.
Figma uses a grey fill by default. You can change the fill using the settings in the
Fill
section of the right sidebar. Learn more about
fill properties
Round the corners of a shape
You can round individual corners of a vector network using the
Corner radius
setting in the right sidebar. If the vector network is an open path, you can use caps to round endpoints. Learn more about
corner radius and smoothing
