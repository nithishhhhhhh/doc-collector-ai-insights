There are a couple of ways to remove a style, component, or variable: you can hide it when publishing, or delete it entirely.

Hide a style
Hide a style when the style is already published
To hide a style when it is already published in a library, you need to unpublish it. You can only hide a style from the original file where the style is defined.
You can access the original style from any object that is currently using it:
Select an object in the canvas that uses that style.
Click on the style in the right sidebar
Click the
icon to edit the style.
Click
Go to style definition
to open the style in the library.
Note:
You will also see an option to
Move style definition into this file
. This allows you to edit or delete that style without leaving the current file. Moving a style removes it from the original file. If you re-publish the original file, the style would no longer be included.
Hide a style when publishing it for the first time
You can hide a style from a library without deleting the style itself. You can only do this from the original style, the style definition.
Open the file where the style lives.
Click
Assets
in the left sidebar, then click the
Libraries
icon. The tooltip may read
Review library updates
if there are updates to libraries you are using in the file, or
Review unpublished changes
if you have unpublished updates in your file.
Click
Publish # changes
Right-click the style and select
Hide when publishing
Repeat for any other style you want to unpublish.
Click
Publish
to apply your changes and remove the styles.
Note:
If the library is published and up to date, you need to make changes to it to remove the style. Make changes to a library by editing or creating a main component or style. Then follow the instructions above starting with step 2.
Delete a style
If you don't want to use a style at all, you can delete it. This won't update the properties of any layers using those styles, but will detach them from the style. You can only delete the style definition in the file it originates from.
Click an empty spot on the canvas or press
Esc
to deselect all layers.
From Local styles in the right sidebar, select one or more styles:
Hold down
Shift
and click to select a range styles
Hold down
⌘ Command
Control
and click to select multiple non-adjacent styles.
Select
Delete style
Delete all
from the options. Figma will remove the style and you will no longer be able to use it.
Publish your changes to your library
Hide a component
You can hide components when you publish your library. You can only hide components from the file they originate from.
Note:
You can open the file for any component from any file with access to those components. Right-click on an instance of that component in the canvas and select
Go to Main component
Open the library file which contains your main component.
Open the
Assets
panel in the left sidebar.
Right-click on the component and select
Hide when publishing
Figma will move the component(s) to the
Hidden
section.
Publish the changes to your Team library
Tip:
You can also quickly remove a component from your Team library via the
Layers Panel.
Add a period
to the beginning of the component's name.
Hide a variable
Like styles and components, you can hide variables when publishing your library. You can only hide variables from the file they originate from.
Open the library file where the variable is defined.
Click an empty spot on the canvas or press
Esc
to deselect all layers.
From
Local variables
in the right sidebar, click the
Open variables
icon.
From the
Variables
modal, find the variable you’d like to hide and click the
Edit variable
icon at the end of the row.
Check the
Hide from publishing
box and
publish your changes
Hide a variable collection
To hide an entire collection of variables from publishing to team libraries, prefix the collection name with
. For example, rename a Tokens collection to
_Tokens
.Tokens
to prevent it from being published. Remove the prefix to unhide it from publishing.
