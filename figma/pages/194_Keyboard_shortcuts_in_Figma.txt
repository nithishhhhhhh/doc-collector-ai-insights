When you're getting into a state of flow, the line between tool and designer blurs, giving you the freedom to explore the problems you're trying to solve. To save you from any unnecessary clicking and scrolling, we've put some handy keyboard shortcuts at your fingertips.
Note:
It's currently not possible to create custom keyboard shortcuts. This is something to consider if you have applications with conflicting shortcuts. For example: a shortcut to open your password manager.
