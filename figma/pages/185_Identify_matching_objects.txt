==================================================

Matching objects are identical objects that exist across more than one frame. For example, many app designs use an identical header across the top of each frame.
Use matching objects to save time when selecting, editing, and prototyping.
Matching objects are used with:
Smart animate
: Create advanced animations between matching objects when prototyping
Multi-edit
: Edit objects in bulk
State management
: When prototyping, share the state of interactive components, frames with scroll, and videos when navigating between frames with matching objects
Matching interactions
: Select and edit prototyping interactions on matching objects in bulk
In order for two objects to be considered matching, they must:
Match layer names
Match parent frames
Match layer hierarchy
Matching object requirements
Figma uses the following terms to help define matching object requirements:
Parent objects
: Objects such as frames, components, and groups, that contain other objects.
Grandparent objects
are objects that contain the parent object.
Ancestors
are any other objects in the hierarchy that contain child, parent, or grandparent objects.
Children
, or
child objects
: Objects that are contained within a parent.
Top-level frames
: Frames placed directly on the canvas. They do not have any parent objects.
Learn more about parent, child and sibling relationships.
Note:
Top-level frames can be matching objects, but only for
smart animate
state management
. You cannot use
multi-edit
select matching interactions
on top-level frames.
Objects in
sections
can only match with other objects within that section.
Layer names
Objects must have the same layer name.
There is one exception to this rule:
Text layers
Text layers donâ€™t always require identical layer names. When you create a text layer, the name of the layer will reflect the content of the text itself. You have the option to rename the text layer.
If the text layers were explicitly
named or renamed from the Layers panel
, the names must match.
If the text layers were implicitly named based on the text content, their
text styles
must match. If there are multiple matching text objects, the best match will be selected based on the x and y coordinates of the text layer in the frame.
Parent frames
All parent and ancestor frames of the objects must have matching names. The names of top-level frames do not need to match.
Note:
Top-level frames and variant names in a component set do not need to match.
Layer hierarchy
In order to be considered matching, objects must have the same position in layer hierarchy across top-level frames. For example, an object that has a parent and grandparent layer in one frame must also have a parent and grandparent layer in the second frame.
Tip
When all requirements match, and there are two or more objects with the same name in a frame, the index of the object within the parent frame is used to determine which one matches.
Identify matching objects
To highlight matching objects on the same page:
Click to select an object.
Hold
Shift
to highlight all matching objects in light blue.
Alternatively, you can identify matching objects from the
Prototype
tab.
Open the
Prototype
tab in the right sidebar.
Hover over an object or layer in the canvas.
Figma will highlight the matching object in any other frames it exists in.
