==================================================

Before you Start
Who can use this feature
Available on
any plan
Anyone with
can edit
access to a file can convert text layers to vector paths
You can convert any text layer into a vector path. Once converted, you can use
vector edit mode
to modify the layer's path. This is useful for:
Customize aspects of a typeface
Creating logos or wordmarks
Preparing assets for printing
Reducing file or export size
Combining multiple paths into a single object
There are two ways to turn a text layer into a vector path: flattening the layer or outlining the layer's stroke. Both methods are destructive actions, meaning you'll no longer be able to edit the text contents or any typography properties associated with it. If you convert a text layer by mistake, you can use the file's
version history
to restore a previous version or use the undo shortcut:
Mac:
Command
Windows:
Control

Flatten a text layer
When you flatten text layers, Figma will:
Combine any objects or layers you selected into a single layer
Convert text layers from editable text to vector paths
To flatten a text layer:
Select the text layer you want to flatten.
Right-click on the selection and select
Flatten
or use the keyboard shortcut:
Mac
Option
Shift
Windows
Alt
Shift
Once flattened, the layers will be combined into a single vector layer. Select the layer and press
Enter
to open
vector edit mode
Outline a layer's stroke
When you use outline stroke, Figma will:
Convert text layers from editable text to vector paths
Not combine any objects or layers you selected into a single layer
To apply outline stroke:
Select the layer in the canvas.
Right-click on the layer and select
Outline stroke
or use the keyboard shortcut:
Mac:
Command
Option
Windows:
Control
Alt
When
Outline stroke
is applied, each glyph is converted to its own vector layer, so you can edit each layer individually in
vector edit mode
