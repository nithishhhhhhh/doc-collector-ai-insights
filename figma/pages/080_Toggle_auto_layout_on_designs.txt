Use auto layout
You can use auto layout on a frame or a selection of objects. This includes:
New or empty frames
Frames with existing content
Components and component sets
Groups or other selections of layers and/or objects
To use auto layout, select one or more layers and use one of the following methods:
Use the keyboard shortcut
⇧ Shift
In the right panel, click
next to
Auto layout
Right-click on a frame or object and select
Add auto layout
If you have a frame or a main component selected, you can also choose from one of the auto layout flows in the
Layout
section of the right sidebar:
Vertical
Horizontal
Grid
Note:
Auto layout is only supported on frames. If you have a one or more layers selected, Figma will create an auto layout frame around them.
Suggest auto layout
When you use
Suggest auto layout
, Figma will try to determine which objects in a frame or component should be placed in an auto layout frame, then adds as many auto layout frames as needed to make the full design responsive. These auto layout frames are created all at once, while attempting to preserve the placement of your designs.
This saves you time so that you don’t have to do the tedious work of adding auto layout frame-by-frame.
Note:
Suggest auto layout can handle moderately-complex designs, such as cards, navigation bars, or mobile screens. If you’re working with a large or complex design, such as website, use suggest auto layout in batches.
You can access this option from a few places:
Use the keyboard shortcut:
Mac:
⌃ Control
⇧ Shift
Windows
⌃ Control
Alt
⇧ Shift
Right-click the frame or object and go to
More layout options
Suggest auto layout
Select
Suggest auto layout
from the Actions menu
After you use this action, any nested auto layout frames that were created are indicated with a blue dot in the layers section in the left panel.
Note:
Occasionally, you may find an object in a different auto layout frame than you intended; or with a horizontal direction applied when you wanted vertical. Suggest auto layout might not get it right every time, but it is intended to speed up your workflow.
For elements that may be a bit trickier, we recommend framing, grouping, or using auto layout on nested elements before using
Suggest auto layout
on the parent frame.
Remove auto layout
When you remove auto layout, you will have access to a frame's regular properties.
There are a couple of ways to remove auto layout:
In the right sidebar, click
Freeform
Remove auto layout
Right-click on the frame and select
Remove auto layout
Use keyboard shortcuts:
Mac:
⌥ Option
⇧ Shift
Windows:
Alt
⇧ Shift
Remove all auto layout in a selection
To remove auto layout from a frame and all of its nested objects at once, right-click on the frame and go to
More layout options
Remove all auto layout
Note:
Auto layout cannot be removed from component instances. You will need to detach the instance from the component to make these edits, or update the main component.
