When prototyping in Figma, you can create multiple flows to test different parts of a user’s journey.
flow
is a collection of connected frames that make up a single prototype experience. For example, you can create a prototype for a shopping app that includes a flow for account creation, another for browsing items, and another for the checkout process–all in one page.
Create a prototype flow
Flow starting points
A flow starting point is where the flow begins. Flow starting points are set on
top-level frames
When you
add a connection
between two frames with no existing connections, Figma will create a starting point on the top-level frame where the connection started. Flow starting points are shown on the canvas with a
blue preview icon and the flow name.
A frame can only have one flow starting point.
You can also manually create a flow starting point.
Select the starting frame.
Select the
Prototype
tab from the right sidebar.
Click the
plus sign in the
Flow starting point
section.
To see all flow starting points on the current page:
Deselect any objects by clicking an empty part of the canvas.
Select the
Prototype
tab from the right sidebar.
From the
Flows
section, view a list of all flow starting points.
Hover over a flow name and click
Select frame
to navigate to the frame where the starting point is located.
Add or remove frames from a flow
Once you have a flow starting point, the rest of the flow consists of any frames that are connected to the starting point with prototyping interactions. This includes frames that are directly connected to the starting point, as well as frames that are connected through other interactions.
For example, all purple frames in the image below are included in
Flow 1
To remove a frame from a flow, remove any prototype interactions that connect the frame to other frames in the flow.
Frames can be included in multiple flows. For example, the blue frame in the image below is included in both
Flow 1
and
Flow 2
Once a user navigates to a frame that is included in multiple flows, they can use any interactions on that frame. This opens up the original flow to include any connections from that frame.
Manage prototype flows
Edit flow name
Once you've created a flow, Figma will name it
Flow 1
by default, with additional flows being
Flow 2
Flow 3
, and so forth. You can rename a flow at any time.
To rename a flow:
Select the starting frame.
Select the
Prototype
tab from the right sidebar.
From the
Flow starting point
section, select the flow name field.
Enter in a new flow name.
Once renamed, the flow name is displayed in the frame's blue starting point icon and the left sidebar in
presentation view
Tip:
You can also rename a flow by double-clicking the flow starting point name directly on the canvas.
Add flow description
Flow names and descriptions are displayed in the left sidebar when in presentation view. Use descriptions to provide prompts to usability test participants or additional context and documentation for your team. Descriptions can be formatted with bold text, numbered or bulleted lists, and hyperlinks.
To add a flow description:
Select the frame with the flow starting point.
Select the
Prototype
tab from the right sidebar.
From the
Flow starting point
section, click
Edit description
next to the name of the flow you’d like to edit.
Add a rich text description.
Click X to exit the
Description
panel and save the description.
Once added, the description is displayed in the left sidebar in presentation view.
Move flow starting point
By default, Figma uses the first connection you create as the flow starting point. You can move a starting point to another frame.
Find the blue starting point icon on the canvas.
Click and drag the flow name to a new starting frame.
Delete flow starting point
To delete a flow starting point:
Select the frame with the flow starting point.
Select the
Prototype
tab from the right sidebar.
From the
Flow starting point
section, click
Remove starting point
Tip:
You can also delete a flow starting point by finding the blue starting point icon on the canvas, and clicking and dragging it off the frame to an empty part of the canvas.
Play and share prototype flows
Preview flows
You can preview your prototype flows directly in the editor, with an
inline preview
Deselect any objects by clicking an empty part of the canvas.
Select the
Prototype
tab from the right sidebar.
From the
Flows
section, view a list of all flows.
Hover over a flow name and click
Preview
to open the inline preview.
From the inline preview, navigate through your flow by triggering each prototype interaction.
Tip:
You can also open the inline preview by clicking the
blue preview icon on any flow starting point.
Copy and share flow links
You can share prototype flows with others in order to get feedback on specific user flows or journeys. When you share a prototype flow, users can play the prototype in presentation view. From presentation view, users can also select any other flow to play.
From the canvas:
Select the frame with the flow starting point.
Select the
Prototype
tab from the right sidebar.
Hover next to the
Flow starting point
heading.
Click
Copy link
From presentation view:
Select the flow you want to share from the left sidebar.
Click
Share prototype
in the toolbar.
