This article is for using cursor chat in Figma Design.
Read about cursor chat in FigJam â†’
Cursor chat allows you to type live, temporary messages to others in your Figma file. This is great for quick communication, such as:
Getting a collaborator's attention ("Love this!")
Lightweight collaboration ("Is this the latest version for production?")
Discussions about the contents of a file ("Is this the right color?")
Spontaneous file encounters ("I'm in here too! Wanna voice chat?")
Enter cursor chat
Enter cursor chat mode through the following ways:
Use keyboard shortcut
Right-click the canvas and select
Cursor chat
An empty speech bubble will appear next to your cursor.
Your chat bubble is anchored to your cursor and follows you around the canvas. You can pan around and pinch-to-zoom the canvas without exiting cursor chat.
Use cursor chat
Once cursor chat mode is activated, start typing and other collaborators in your file will see what you're typing as you're typing it. Because cursor chat is live, there is no action to confirm or send your message. Your cursor displays the message for five seconds after you're done typing.
Clear your chat
To clear your chat and type a new message, press
Esc
on your keyboard. Your previous message will disappear, and you can immediately type a new one.
A single chat has a 52 character limit. You can press
Enter
Return
on your keyboard to create a new line. When you type on the new line, Figma will remove your previous message.
Note:
Figma does not keep a log of messages from cursor chat. Once you clear your chat, it'll disappear forever. If you need your messages to be permanent, consider
dropping a comment
instead.
Exit cursor chat
There are several ways to quickly exit out of cursor chat mode:
Press
Esc
Click anywhere in your file
Switch to a different tool
Open a menu
FigJam also eventually fades your cursor chat and switches you back to the move tool if you haven't typed a new message in a while.
