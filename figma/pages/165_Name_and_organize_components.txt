Before you Start
Who can use this feature
Available on
any plan
Anyone with

access to a file can rename layers, including components
New to components? Check out our
Guide to components
and
Guide to libraries
articles.
Name and organize your components to ensure consistency across your design system, and make them easier to find in the
assets tab
and when
swapping related component instances
. We recommend defining and documenting a component naming structure within your team or company.
Tip:
Not sure where to start with building a component library? Our
Best practices: components, styles, and shared libraries
article has some great suggestions.
Component organization in the assets tab
In the assets tab, the organization of components mirrors the file's structure. You will see this general path:
file > page > frame
You can click on each library file to see its pages. Figma displays pages in alphanumeric order, not the order they are listed in the original file.
Then click on a specific page name to explore the components within. When you click on a component, you'll see a fly-out with more details, such as the component's description and properties.
Component organization in the swap instance menu
You can view details about a selected instance at the top of the
Design
tab in the right sidebar.
From here, you can click
next to the component's name to open the Swap instance window, which displays related components that you can swap the selected instance to.
We determine related components by:
How the main component is named
. For example, we will display
UI/Button/
Active
UI/Button/
Hover
and
UI/Button/
Inactive
together.
How the main component is arranged in the original file
. For example, components within the same frame or section are considered related.
Organize components by name
To add another layer of organization, you can use naming conventions to categorize your components and add consistency across your files. We recommend you use the slash-separated convention, such as
Component/State
Icon/Name
This might look like:
Button/Active
Button/Hover
Button/Inactive
Icon/Alert
Icon/Profile
Icon/Close

Organize components via file structure
To illustrate the importance of component organization, the following example will walk through how you can define your file structure and name its pages and frames to determine the location of your components within.
In a file named
Figma UI
, we'll create components that make up the Figma UI.
In the file, we'll create a page called
Icons
, which houses all of our icon components.
We support two sizes for each icon, 16px and 32px. We'll create two sections for each size, and name them accordingly
and
, then place the icon components into their corresponding sections.
To make it easier to differentiate between the icon sizes, we'll make sure to include the icon's size in its name. For example,
icon-16-home
and
icon-32-home
In another file, we've created a dialog window that needs a close
icon. We've already created and published this close icon component in our Figma UI file, so we'll use an instance of that component in our other file.
Note:
For this approach, you will need to
publish your library
and
add it to the other file
. The ability to publish libraries is only available on our
paid plans
From the other file, we'll go to the assets tab and locate our Figma UI library file. We'll click the file name, open the Icons page, and select either the 16 or 32 section.
We need the 32px version of that icon, so we'll select that one and then drag that component from the
Assets
tab into the file.
