access to a file can detach component instances
You can detach any instance from its main component. This is useful if you want to make changes to the component that
aren't supported by overrides
Or, if you want to create a variation of a component from your changes.
When you detach an instance, Figma will:
Make the instance a regular frame, while keeping the current layers and properties.
Remove the link to the original component.
No longer apply any changes made to the component, to that object.
Note:
Figma Organizations can

If you want to revert something that's been a component for a while:
