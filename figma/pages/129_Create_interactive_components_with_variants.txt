Guide to prototyping in Figma →
Interactive components allow you to create prototype interactions between variants in a component set. Any time you add an instance to your designs, those interactions are set up and ready to go. This saves you time when creating prototypes and prevents unnecessary noodle soup.
Create interactive elements that automatically switch between variants, like buttons that change from hover to pressed states.
Set default interactions at a component level and remove the guesswork when it comes to building prototypes.
Reduce the amount of frames and connections needed to prototype input fields, like a set of checkboxes or toggles.
Note:
Interactive components are an extension of variants. If you don't have a component set to work with, you'll need to create one first.
Learn how to create and use variants →
Before variant interactions
In the example below we've added all the possible connections to prototype a frame with five checkboxes. Without interactive components, we would need to duplicate the same frame 32 times and create 160 connections between them to prototype every possible combination.
With variant interactions
With interactive components, we only need to add an instance of the checkbox to our design and its variant interactions are ready to go. When we view the prototype, Figma automatically switches between the checked and unchecked variants.
Create interactive components
You can only create interactive components using variants from the same component set. If you don't have a component set to work with, you'll need to create one first.

Create variant interactions
Interactive components introduces a new

tab of the right sidebar.
Click the
on the frame's bounding box and drag it to the destination variant. You can also click the
in the
Interactions
section of the
Prototype
panel, set the action to

, then select the destination variant using the dropdown menu.
Once the connection has been made, use the
Interaction
panel to adjust the trigger and action.
You can also use the
Change to
action on a nested instance to change the parent component variant. In the example below, a variant from a component set is nested within another
Expandable
component set. A
Change to
interaction is placed on the nested instance to change the parent component from its
Collapsed
variant to its
Expanded
variant.

Use interactive components
Add instances of interactive components to your designs like any other component. The only difference is the instances already have interactions applied for prototyping.
To use interactive components:
Add an instance
of an interactive component to a frame in your design.
When you're ready to prototype your design, navigate to the
Prototype
tab of the right sidebar.
Build your prototype
Preview designs and interactions in Presentation view
Note:
Figma will
use the existing rules to preserve any overrides
you apply to the default variant in a component set. For example: changing the contents of a button label or swapping an icon.
When you add an instance of a component set to the canvas, you also bring along the other variants in that component set. While you can technically still apply overrides to those other variants, Figma won't reflect those overrides in presentation view.
Add more interactions
When you're building a prototype with interactive components, you can add regular interactions on top of the variant interactions.
In the example below, we have added an interaction with a hover trigger on top of the variant interaction triggered by a click.
The interaction order will depend on whether the triggers you use are the same triggers as the variant interactions.
Learn more about prototype triggers →
Same triggers
When both interactions use the same trigger, Figma will use the prototype interaction and ignore the variant interaction.
For example:
A toggle switch has an
On click
Change to
variant interaction between the
and
Off
variants in its component set.
You add an
On click
Navigate to
interaction from the toggle switch to another frame.
Figma will navigate to the next frame when the user clicks on the toggle switch.
Different triggers
When you add an interaction with a different trigger, Figma will play both the interaction and the variant interactions.
For example:
A button has an
On hover
Change to
variant interaction between the
default
and
hover
variants.
You add an
On click
Navigate to
interaction when building your prototype.
Figma will
Change to
the
hover
variant on
hover
, then
Navigate to
the next frame
On click
View interactions
When using interactive components, you will see separate sections for
Interactions
and
Variant interactions
in the
Prototype
tab of the right sidebar.
Use the
Interactions
section to
create prototype interactions and animations
Use the
Variant interactions
section view a variant interaction's details
Edit variant interactions
You can override a variant interaction for an instance in your prototype. If you want to edit a variant interaction for the main component, you'll need to do so from the source file.
To access a component set from an instance and make your edits:
In design mode, select the instance.
At the top of the right sidebar, click
Select
Go to main component
Navigate to the
Prototype
tab of the right sidebar.
Make your edits to the variant interactions.
State management across frames
Your prototypes likely involve interactions across multiple frames. By default, Figma uses state management controls to determine how interactive components work across frames.
State memorization
: Figma memorizes the last set variant of your interactive component.
For example, you might have an interactive component for a checkbox. If you set the interactive component to the checked variant, Figma remembers the state of that variant. This means that if you navigate away from that frame and come back to it later, the interactive component will remain in the checked state.
State sharing
: Figma shares states between matching interactive components. States are only shared after the component has been initially interacted with.
For example, you might have an interactive component for a checkbox, with an instance of the component on each of two frames. If you set the interactive component to the checked variant on the first frame, then navigate to the second frame, the matching component on the second frame will also be set to the checked variant.
If you don’t want to maintain states across frames, check off
Reset component state
on the
Interaction details
panel of the prototype interaction.

Use with variables

variables
to interactive components to extend their power even further.
When you click an interactive component with an applied variable:

The variable updates, which in turn updates any other elements bound to that same variable

Interactive components with custom fonts
When using custom fonts for text inside interactive components, keep in mind that prototype viewers might not have those custom fonts installed on their devices. In these cases, Figma uses cached information about variants of interactive components to display custom fonts correctly when presenting a prototype, but may replace a font with Inter when we can’t both preserve text overrides and change font settings for an interaction.
For example, let's say a person viewing your prototype doesn't have the custom font being used installed on their device. If an instance of an interactive component has a text overrides:
Figma may replace the custom font with Inter if the change in variants includes changing a font setting like weight or underline.
Figma will display the correct font if the change in variant isn't related to a font setting, like a button's background color.
We recommend using
Google fonts
for prototypes that are being shared with viewers who may not have access to custom fonts in your designs.
If your team is on the
Organization or Enterprise plan
, you can make sure prototype viewers have access to custom fonts by
uploading them as shared fonts
