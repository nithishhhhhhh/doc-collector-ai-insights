New to Prototyping? Check out our
Getting Started with Prototyping
guide.
All prototypes start with a single interaction. Each interaction has a
trigger
and an
action
The trigger determines what type of
interaction with the hotspot
will cause the prototype to advance. This could be a mouse or touch interaction like tap, drag, click, and more.
This article covers our prototyping triggers in more detail.

prototype actions →
On click/On tap
Triggers the action when the user
Clicks
(desktop) or
Taps
(mobile) on a hotspot in your prototype. You can add click or tap triggers to lots of different elements in a screen.
You can use them for navigation like opening links, using menus, or exploring websites. They can also be used when you need a user to click on buttons, fill in forms, or confirm and dismiss alerts.
On drag
Allows you to perform an action when you drag an element on the screen. This can be the entire frame or a single element like a slider.
You can use the
On Drag
in any direction: Left, Right, Up or Down. This is great for simple swipe gestures, or for more complex animations like a drag to refresh.
Drag allows you to move back and forward through the transition. This creates a continuum, instead of performing the action after a swipe gesture.
While hovering
Triggers the action when you hover over the hotspot. You can use this to replicate tooltips, on-screen prompts, or changes in state.
We will return the user to the original frame when they move the cursor off the hotspot. This makes it a great interaction when you don't want to take users away from the current screen.
While pressing
Triggers the action when you
click and hold
the mouse or trackpad on a desktop. Or, when you
tap and hold
on a mobile device.
You can use this trigger for navigating drop-down menus, or replicating long-press interactions like viewing a preview using 3D Touch on iOS.
When released, we will take the user back to the original Frame. This makes it great for Overlays that capture temporary interactions or state changes.
Keyboard/Gamepad
The Keyboard / Gamepad trigger lets you replicate interactions with a keyboard shortcut. This applies to user inputs from keyboards, controllers, and gamepads.
A trigger can be a single key or button, or a combination of keys.
For example: a trigger can be based on the user pressing the Enter key or ✕ button on a controller. Or using a shortcut like
Shift
Note:
We officially support the Xbox One, PS4, and Nintendo Switch Pro Controllers. Other controllers may work, but buttons displayed in Figma may not accurately reflect the controller.
Mouse enter
This shows the
Destination
frame when the mouse
enters
the hotspot area. This could be a small area like a button, or an entire section of the screen.
You could use this to expose the options in a drop down menu as your mouse enters the field. The menu will stay open until the user performs another interaction like selecting an item or clicking out of the field.
Once you’ve set up a
Mouse enter
event, you might want to set up a
Mouse leave
trigger to reverse the action on leaving the hotspot.
Note:
On November 16, 2023, Figma updated the behavior of the
Mouse enter
trigger to more accurately reflect the trigger name and description.
Mouse move inside
interactions trigger anytime the mouse moves inside the hotspot.
Mouse enter
interactions only trigger when the mouse initially enters the hotspot.
To keep existing prototypes intact, interactions created before November 16, 2023 are now labeled
Mouse move inside
Mouse move inside
interactions can no longer be created. All new interactions have the
Mouse enter
trigger.
Mouse leave
This shows the
Destination
frame when the cursor
leaves
the hotspot area.
You could use this for on-screen prompts, like an alert when you haven't completed a field or checked a box.
Note:
On November 16, 2023, Figma updated the behavior of the
Mouse leave
trigger to more accurately reflect the trigger name and description.
Mouse move outside
interactions trigger anytime the mouse moves outside the hotspot.
Mouse leave
interactions only trigger when the mouse initially leaves the hotspot.
To keep existing prototypes intact, interactions created before November 16, 2023 are now labeled
Mouse move outside
Mouse move outside
interactions can no longer be created. All new interactions have the
Mouse leave
trigger.
Mouse down (touch down)
This triggers the
Destination
frame when you first press the mouse or touch pad. For mobile devices, this is when the user's finger first touches the hotspot.
Mouse up (touch up)
This triggers the
Destination
frame when you release the mouse or touch pad. For mobile devices, this is once the user's finger no longer touches the Hotspot.
Apply the
Mouse Down
trigger to the menu header to open an Overlay.
Apply the
Mouse Up
interaction to the menu item in the Overlay.
When they release the mouse, we take the user to the relevant Frame.
Tip:
Use the
Mouse Down
and
Mouse Up
triggers together to replicate a user navigating a drop-down menu.
After delay
The
After delay
trigger allows you to trigger an action after the user has spent a certain amount of time on a given frame. You will need to set the duration of the delay in milliseconds (ms).
When video hits
The
When video hits
trigger is available for any connection that begins on a video file.
It allows you to set an action when the video hits a specific timestamp. This can be helpful when building prototypes for things like video ad breaks or triggering an overlay message during video playback.
If you select the
When video hits
trigger, there is a field to enter in a timestamp.
Note:
If you enter a timestamp beyond the full length of the video, the action is triggered when the video ends.

When video ends
The
When video ends
trigger is available for any connection that begins on a video file.
It allows you to set an action when the video ends. This can be helpful when sequencing videos or creating an interactive video player experience.
