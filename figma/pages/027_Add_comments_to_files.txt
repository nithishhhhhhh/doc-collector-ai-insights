@mention
collaborators in comments by pressing
symbol and typing their name. This allows you to include a collaborator in the comment thread or draw their attention to a specific part of the design file.
There are some restrictions around @mention behavior depending on your permissions level—owner, admin, can edit, or can view—and your plan:
Personal user account
Can mention:
Users who have permissions on the file or who have previously commented on the file
Users who have permissions on a non-organization project or a team you have permissions on
Users who share the same permission level as you and who are in the last 100 users you’ve interacted with in Figma
Starter, education or professional team
Members can mention:
All team members
Users who have permissions on the file or who have previously commented on the file
Non-members who have permissions on any team resources
Non-members can mention users who are in the last 250 users you’ve interacted with in Figma that are either a member of the team or who have permissions on a team resource
Organization or enterprise
Members can mention all members and guests
Guests can mention:
Users who share the same permission level as you on folders or teams in the organization
The last 100 organization members you’ve interacted with in Figma
Users who have permissions on the file or who have previously commented on the file
Add a mention to a comment
Mention a collaborator when you add a new comment, or reply to an existing one.
In the comment field, click
or press the
key on your keyboard to trigger a mention.
Start typing in the person's
name
email
. Figma will suggest collaborators based on your history.
Click on the person's name in the list.
Figma will show mentions in blue text. Complete the rest of your message and click
Submit
Figma will send an email to the collaborator with the details of your comment and a preview of the design. If they have in-app notifications enabled, they will receive a notification in Figma too.
Note:
If you'd like to mention someone who is missing from your list, then you will need to
invite them to the file
first.
Add media to comments
You can attach up to 5 images or GIFs when adding or replying to comments. Comments support PNG, JPEG, and GIF media formats.

In the comment field, begin typing your message then click the
