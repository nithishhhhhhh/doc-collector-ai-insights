==================================================

Inspecting designs helps developers or other stakeholders understand the structure and properties of a design so they can more easily translate it to code.
How you inspect a design file depends on your
plan type
seat type
, and your
file permissions
. Use the tool below to see how to do common inspection tasks—exporting, measuring, generating code, viewing annotations, and using plugins for development—based on your personal access to the file you’d like to inspect.
No matter your file access, there is an inspect experience available to you.
First, check to see if you have access to Dev Mode in the file you’re inspecting by toggling to Dev Mode at the top of the file or by using the keyboard shortcut
Shift
. If you don't have access to Dev Mode, you’ll be inspecting in Design Mode. You can select if you have

With view-only access to a design, you can use inspection tools directly within Design Mode:
Measure distances
You can measure distances between objects, even if they are nested within frames, groups, or components.
Select the first object on the canvas.
Hold down the modifier key:
Mac: ⌥ Option
Windows: Alt
Hover over the second object.
Figma will display a red line between the two objects, as well as horizontal and vertical measurements.

I have Dev Mode
To inspect designs, enter Dev Mode by selecting the
Dev Mode toggle by using the keyboard shortcut
Shift
. From there, you can use the following inspection tools:
Measure distances
You can measure distances between objects, even if they are nested within frames, groups, or components. In Dev Mode, select any parent or child layer on the canvas. When you hover over surrounding layers, Figma displays padding values or distances between the two objects. You can also measure the distance between specific objects:
Select the first object in the canvas.
Hold down the modifier key:
Mac: ⌥ Option
Windows: Alt
Hover over the second object.
Figma will display a red line between the two objects, as well as horizontal and vertical measurements.
Generate code
Click any object on the canvas while in Dev Mode to populate the
Code
section in the inspect panel. Depending on what’s selected, a typographic preview or box model is displayed, followed by autogenerated code snippets for the object.
To change your language and unit selection, or use a codegen plugin:
In the top-right of the
Code
section, select a language or plugin from the dropdown.
If required, click
Inspect settings
and select a unit from the dropdown.
Learn how to use code snippets in Dev Mode.
Note:
Some Dev Mode features like the
Code
section won't appear in the inspect panel if
copying and sharing are disabled on the file
View properties
In Dev Mode, the
Inspect
tab gives you a list of properties for objects on the canvas. This includes properties like: layout, color, typography, text strings, component properties, styles, and variables. To view the properties of an object:
In Dev Mode, select an object on the canvas.
In the Inspect tab in the right sidebar, scroll to the section with the properties you’d like to inspect.
Tip:
When inspecting a component or instance, you'll see a component preview, a link to the main component, as well as any links to relevant documentation and dev resources. The component playground appears in the
Inspect
panel when a component instance is selected. Use the playground to experiment with the components different properties without changing the actual design.
Explore variables
Dev Mode includes a few ways of working with variables when you're inspecting a design:
View details about a variable
, including the value and mode. You can swap modes, and, if the value uses any aliases, the entire alias chain down to the variable's raw value.
Get suggested variables
for raw values in a design, if the values match one or more of your existing variables.
Access the variable collections created in the current file
and view all the variables and modes in a table.
For more details, see
Variables in Dev Mode
Export assets
Dev Mode can automatically detect icons and present them as downloadable assets for developers. You’ll see these assets in the
Inspect
tab above the export settings. Hover over any item, select a file type, and click the download icon.
To set up a custom export:
In Dev Mode, select the layers you want to export.
In the
Inspect
tab, click the
plus icon in the
Export
section to add an export configuration. You can add as many export configurations to a selection as needed.
Configure the export settings. Learn more about
Figma's export formats and settings
If needed, click
Preview
to see how your asset will look. If you have multiple objects selected, the
Preview
setting does not display.
Click
Export
Specify size of image export
Download any selected image on the canvas, and choose between downloading the image at its current size on the canvas or the original image at full resolution.
In Dev Mode, select the image you want to download.
From the
Assets
section in the right sidebar, hover over the image you want to download and click the
Export
icon that appears.
From the dropdown, choose from one of the options:
Source image file
: Download the original image that was used when the image was first imported into Figma.
Layer export
: Download the image at its current layer size.
Tip
: If you’d like to do a
layer export
, you can choose which file format to export the image to. In the
Assets
section, click
the
Open image export settings
icon, then use the dropdown to choose from PNG, JPEG, SVG, or PDF formats.
View or add annotations
With annotations, designers can communicate key details about a design directly to developers. This includes highlighting important properties, visualizing spacing and sizing with measurements, or sharing context with text notes.
In Dev Mode, annotations appear on the canvas as a green dot. Click an annotation to reveal its contents.
Note
: You need a
full seat
and
can edit
access to add annotations to a file.
To add annotations to a design:
Click the Dev Mode toggle in the top-right of the toolbar or use the keyboard shortcut
Shift
Click
Annotate
in the toolbar or use the keyboard shortcut
Shift
Select the layer you’d like to annotate.
Write a note in the text field, or click
+ Property
to select a property from the list. You can include both plain text and properties in an annotation.
To add a measurement to a design:
Click
Measure
in the toolbar or use the keyboard shortcut
Shift
Hover over a layer to see options for where to start your measurement.
Click and drag from your starting point to the layer where you want the measurement to end.
Click and drag the measurement so it doesn’t cover the design.
Use plugins
The
Plugins
tab in Dev Mode shows your recently used plugins, as well as recommended plugins from the Figma Community.

Compare changes
If a frame or component has been updated since you last viewed it, you can compare its version history. This helps you track the latest updates and keep production code accurate.
You can also compare detached components—or instances with design overrides—against the base component.
Select a top-level frame or component.
In the Inspect tab of the right sidebar, click
Compare changes
Tip:
Hold
Shift
and click to select two components on the canvas to compare them with each other.
