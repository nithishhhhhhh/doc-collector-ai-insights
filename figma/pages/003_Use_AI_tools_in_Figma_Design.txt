There are a few things to keep in mind when using any AI tool:
Accuracy
AI-powered tools are designed to provide information and results based on artificial intelligence algorithms and identify patterns and relationships from large amounts of data. It’s important to note that the accuracy and reliability of these results may vary.
There is a possibility of inaccuracies, omissions, or misleading outcomes due to the complexities and limitations of AI technologies. Therefore, the information provided by the tool should be regarded as a general reference and not a fact or a substitute for expert advice or your own research.
Your responsibilities
You should exercise your own judgment and discretion when using AI-powered tools. It’s essential to verify and cross-check the information provided by the tool before making any decisions, taking actions, or relying on it for critical matters.
You should let others know when you’re using or presenting AI-generated outputs. For some features, like summarize stickies, Figma will indicate when an output is AI-generated.
You will only use AI features in accordance with
Figma’s Acceptable Use Policy
