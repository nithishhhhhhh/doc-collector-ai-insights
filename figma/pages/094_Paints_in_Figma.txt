Paints can be colors, gradients, or images. In Figma, you can use the
Color picker
to apply paints to
fills
and
strokes
Paints can be applied to the following objects and shapes using the
fill

properties:
Text layers
Basic shapes
Vector networks
Boolean operations
Frames
Paint types
There are three different types of paints you can apply:
Solid
: A solid color or paint.
Gradients
: Choose from four different gradients:
Linear (gradient)
: A progressive transition between two colors on a straight line. You can choose the angle of the line.
Radial (gradient)
: A circular gradient that has a color at the center which transitions to another color on the edge. This could be another color, or a fade to transparent.
Diamond (gradient)
: A gradient with four points that starts in the center of the object or layer. You can adjust the width and height of the gradient individually.
Angular (gradient)
: Creates a gradient clockwise from the starting position. You can adjust the location of both colors in the gradient to create a softer or harsher angle.
Pattern
: Pattern fills reference another object on the canvas. Learn more about using
pattern fills
Image or GIF
: A static image or animated GIF. Learn more about
adding images to your designs
Video
: Upload a .mp4, .mov, or .webm video file. Learn more
about using videos
Using gradients
To use a gradient as a fill or stroke:
Select the color swatch in the
Fill
Stroke
section of the right sidebar.
From the color picker, select the
Gradient
icon.
From the dropdown, select either
Linear
Radial
Diamond
, or
Angular
Each gradient will automatically start with two color stops. Color stops are the point where a gradient switches from one color to the next. Learn more about
adjusting colors and using the color picker →
To add additional color stops to a gradient, click anywhere along the gradient color slider.
To remove a color stop from a gradient, click on the stop from the color slider and select
Delete
Backspace
Use variables with gradients
Color variables store individual, raw color values. Learn more about
variables →
Gradients are a blend between two or more colors. You can use variables on color stops in a gradient to maintain consistency in your design system or to take advantage of theming, such as dark and light mode.
To apply a variable to a gradient color stop:
Select the color swatch in the
Fill
Stroke
section of the right sidebar.
From the color picker, select the
Gradient
icon.
Select a color swatch from the list of colors in the gradient.
Select the
Libraries
tab.
Select a color variable to apply to the gradient color stop.
To detach a variable from a gradient color stop:
Hover over the color stop that has the variable applied.
Click
detach.
You can save gradients, which may contain variable values, as styles to be reused in your design. Learn more about
creating color styles →
