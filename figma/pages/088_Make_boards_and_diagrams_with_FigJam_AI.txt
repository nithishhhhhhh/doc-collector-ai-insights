Prompting tips
FigJam AI can take some practice and guidance to make it work for you and your audience. Below are some details you can include in your prompt to get the best results:
FigJam boards
Add your agenda as a bulleted list along with details about what you need for each topic
Outline the goals of the upcoming meeting you are facilitating
Add any context about your attendees including how many participants and their roles
Example:
Letâ€™s say you need to quickly whip up a meeting board for a last-minute launch retrospective session. Weâ€™ll click the text field and select
Team retrospective
from the suggested templates, then provide the following context:
A team retrospective with sections for what went well, kudos, what could have gone better, what we should keep doing.
We can then add
Next steps â†–ï¸Ž
from the suggested sections.
Example:
You want to start hosting your 1:1s in a FigJam file to better visualize your work and keep all meeting discussions in one central file. Weâ€™ll click text and select
1:1
from the suggested templates, then provide the following context:
A 1:1 with my lead where we discuss current projects, upcoming projects, things i need help with, and personal updates.
We can then add
An agenda â†–ï¸Ž
and
A calendar â†–ï¸Ž
Diagrams
Diagrams provide a useful visual reference for things like processes, workflows, or structures. Diagrams are a part of your board and can be made using FigJam AI.
Currently, FigJam AI can create flow charts, Gantt charts, and org charts. Similar to meeting boards, the more detail you provide, the more custom your diagram will be.
Example:
Make a mind map of:
Team activities during an offsite
Foundational growth channels for a new website
Feature ideas for a customer management software
Example:
Make a flow chart for things like:
Uploading a file to AWS
New customers downloading a mobile app
Onboarding a new employee
Example:
Make a Gantt chart with:
Sections for research, design, development, and launch planning
A 3 month timeline
Project milestones every two weeks
Example:
Make a timeline of:
US cultural events to plan marketing moments in 2024
Project roadmap for three teams over the next quarter
Steps to plan a wedding in Hawaii in 6 months
Once your team has added all sorts of great ideas and feedback to the board, you can
use FigJam AI to sort and summarize sticky notes â†’
