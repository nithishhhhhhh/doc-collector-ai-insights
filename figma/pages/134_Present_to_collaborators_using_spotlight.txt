Before you Start

any team or plan
Anyone with

access to a file or prototype can follow.
Spotlight lets you share your view of a Figma Design file or prototype. This allows others to follow along with you and track each movement you make on the canvas, including actions like zooming in or switching between pages. Spotlight does not share your actions in the toolbar, sidebars, or anything outside of the canvas.
Spotlight allows you to:
Walk through designs with remote collaborators
Present designs during a
design crit
Demonstrate tasks and specific actions
Reference a particular part of the file when talking with collaborators
Remove the need for screen-sharing when you have a slow internet connection
Follow students as they complete exercises
Spotlight yourself in a file
Hover over your avatar in the toolbar and click to open the
Multiplayer tools
dropdown menu.
Click
Spotlight me
Everyone currently viewing the file will be notified that you’d like them to follow you. They’ll have a few seconds to click
Not now
before automatically being shown your view of the file. Once you’re in the spotlight, you’ll see how many people are following you and your avatar in the toolbar will have a dashed border.
To stop a spotlight, click
Stop
at the top of your canvas.
Follow another user in a file
Find the person’s avatar in the toolbar.
Do one of the following:
Click on the user’s avatar in the menu bar to automatically follow them.
Hover over the user’s avatar and click
Ask to spotlight
to send them a spotlight request. The user is notified that you would like them to spotlight themselves and can accept or reject the request.
We will display a border around your canvas, in the color of the person's avatar. A message displays at the top of the screen to show who you are following. Once you follow someone, you will see their actions and cursor as they move through the prototype.
To stop following the user, click
Stop following
following
at the top of your canvas.
Note:
We won't tell someone if you follow them. We do still show your cursor's location when you're following a presenter or someone else in a file. If they have
Multiplayer Cursors enabled
, they will be able to see your cursor in their viewport.
Use spotlight in prototypes
You can use spotlight while in
presentation view
. This allows you to follow along with a user while they interact with your prototype.
You can use this to:
Walk through prototype Interactions with remote collaborators
Track what actions a user is performing during a usability test
Switch between presenter views during a presentation
Remotely control a presentation from your phone
To follow someone in a prototype:
Open the prototype in presentation view.
Hover over the top of the screen to show the menu bar.
Do one of the following:
Click on the user’s avatar in the menu bar to automatically follow them
Hover over the user’s avatar and click
Ask to spotlight
to send them a spotlight request. The user is notified that you would like them to spotlight themselves and can accept or reject the request.
Once you follow someone, you will see their actions and cursor as they move through the prototype.
Tip:
If you leave a person’s spotlight and want to rejoin while they are still spotlighting, click
