Before you Start
Who can use this feature
Available on
any plan
Anyone with
can edit
access to a file can flatten objects
Flattening an object merges its layers into a single vector layer, simplifying the design, reducing the file size, and improving asset compatibility.
You can flatten a selection of vector layers to merge them into a complex vector path or flatten a text layer to customize aspects of a typeface for logos or wordmarks. Flattening a container layer, like frames or sections, will merge its child layers together and remove the container layer from the canvas.
Unlike
boolean operations
, flattening is a destructive action. Once an object is flattened, its individual layers cannot be separated again. If you flatten something by mistake, you can use the fileâ€™s
version history
