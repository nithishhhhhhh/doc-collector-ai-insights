About styles
Use styles to define the color, text and any effects applied to objects; or to define the structure and appearance of layout guides.
Create styles for:
Paints and colors
: fill, stroke, background color
Text
: font family, size, line height, spacing
Effects
: drop shadow, inner shadow, layer blur, background blur
Layout guides
: row, column, grid
Whenever you make a change to a style's properties - like updating a text style's color from red to blue - Figma will apply those changes to any objects using that style.
Tip
: Like
components
variables
, styles can be shared by publishing them to your
team library
. This allows you to easily establish and maintain consistent styles across your team projects.
