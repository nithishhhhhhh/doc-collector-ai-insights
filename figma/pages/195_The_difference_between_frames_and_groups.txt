Groups
and
frames
allow you to combine layers together so that they can be treated like a single layer.
Groups
By default, groups take on the combined dimensions of their children.
To make a group, select some layers and choose “Group”, or use:
Mac:
Command
Windows:
Control
The first time you click on a layer in this group, the entire group will be selected.
To select a single layer within this group, double-click the item, or choose it from the layers panel.
As the layers within a group are moved around, the bounds of the group will adjust to fit the layers within.
You can move things into and out of this group by dragging layers within the layers panel.
You are allowed to nest groups inside other groups.
To un-group, select the group and choose “Ungroup”, or use:
Mac:
Shift
Command
Command
Delete
Windows:
Shift
Control
Control
Backspace
Frames
Sometimes, it is useful to have a layer whose size is explicitly set by you. These are called Frames.
To make a frame, choose the Frame Tool
and drag out an area of the screen, or use:
Mac:
Command
Option
Windows:
Control
Alt
To add layers to this group, just drag them in.
To remove layers from this group, just drag them out.
Selecting and moving items within a Frame works exactly the same way as groups.
To un-group, select the group and choose “Ungroup”, or use:
Mac:
Shift
Command
Command
Delete
Windows:
Shift
Control

Backspace
Frames are drawn directly on the canvas and we draw them in a special way to make them easier to see and work with.
