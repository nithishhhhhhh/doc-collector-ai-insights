==================================================

Before you start
Who can use this feature
Available on
any team or plan
Anyone with
can edit
access to a file can create prototypes.
In prototypes, you can navigate through frames to demonstrate a user journey across multiple pages or screens.
Preserving scroll position lets you maintain the same scroll position when you transition between frames. This applies to both vertical and horizontal scroll locations. In older versions of Figma, preserving scroll position was something that needed to be enabled as a part of prototype interactions. Now, scroll position is
preserved by default
after your layers are
prepared for preserving scroll position
In terms of
state management
, the concept of "preserve scroll position" is a combination of
state memorization
and
state sharing
. State memorization preserves the scroll position of content in a given layer of a prototype. State sharing lets the scroll position of content be shared by different layers that meet certain criteria, thus preserving the scroll position throughout the prototype.
Note:
State management allows us to maintain object properties and states when navigating in and across frames when playing prototypes—and can apply to scroll position, interactive components, and videos.
Preserved by default
In your prototypes, the scroll position of top-level frames and scrollable layers is
memorized
by default.
For example, you have a prototype of a map app. In order to simulate the experience of scrolling the map, one of the frames contains an image of the map that overflows the frame. By default, when you navigate away from that frame in the prototype, the current scroll position of the map is memorized. When you return to the frame, the map is at the same position as when you left the frame earlier.
The scroll position of layers is shared by default if the
layers match
. Top-level frames can have
identical names or identical prefixes
, in order to help differentiate between frames in the prototype.
If you want an interaction to reset the scroll position of layers in a top-level frame (the
old state management behavior
), you can override the
state memorization
and
state sharing
behavior with
Reset scroll position

Prepare layers for preserving scroll position
For interactions in your protoypes, scroll position is preserved between matching objects or frames.
Match nested objects
Nested objects are objects placed within another layer or frame. To match nested objects across frames, both of the following criteria must be met:
Objects have identical names
Objects have the same
set of parents
across top-level frames
Match top-level frames
Top-level frames are frames placed directly on the canvas. To match top-level frames,
only one
of the following criteria needs to be met:
Frames have identical names
Frame names have a common prefix, followed by a forward slash. For example, frames
Checkout / Empty
and
Checkout / Complete
match.
Rename layers in bulk
If you have unique names for each layer, but would like match them so scroll position is automatically shared, you can rename multiple layers at the same time to match, or (for top-level frames) add a prefix to the existing name (for example,
Prefix / Name
Select the layers you want to rename by doing one of the following:
Select an initial object on either the canvas or layers panel, then hold down
Shift
while clicking additional objects.
Drag your cursor across any objects you want to select. This creates a blue box around the selected objects.
Open up the rename layers panel:
Mac:
Command
Windows:
Control
In the
Rename to
field, enter a name name, or a prefix that you want to add to the layer name. For a prefix, include a forward slash after the prefix name.
If you're adding a prefix, click the
Current Name
button to add the current layer name after the forward slash.
Click
Rename
to apply the changes.

Reset scroll position
To override the default behavior of
state memorization
and
state sharing
between layers, you can enable
Reset scroll position
when you're configuring an interaction.
To reset the scroll position:
Click on a prototype connection to open the
Interaction
panel.
In the
State
section of the panel, click the
Reset scroll position
checkbox.
Update old state management: Preserve scroll position
On May 24, 2023, Figma updated its prototype state management controls. This update changed how preserve scroll position is applied on interactions.
To preserve scrolling between top-level frames,
the top-level frame names have to be identical
have a matching prefix.
Turn off preserve scroll position
Turn on preserve scroll position
New state management
Use non-matching layer names or check reset scroll position
Use matching layer names
(Top-level frame names can be identical or have a matching prefix)
Old state management
Toggle off the preserve scroll position setting
Toggle on the preserve scroll position setting
Any new interaction automatically follows new state management rules. To update an old interaction to the new state management controls, click the
Update
button on the
Interaction details
modal.
