This article covers one step in the branching process:

Request
Review
Merge
Manage
When you want to apply your branch changes to the main file, you can merge the branch. If you have multiple branches and contributors, we recommend coordinating merges to reduce errors or disruption.
If you have view only access to the main file, you will need to
request a branch review
from someone with edit access.
If you have edit access to the main file, you can go ahead and merge the branch. You can still choose to
request a review
from a collaborator.
Caution
: If you have an active memory limit banner in your file, you can't review and merge changes. Figma will disable the
Review and merge changes
setting. To get updates from the main file or merge a branch, you need to
reduce your memory usage

menu next to the file/branch name.

Side by side
Side by side
view allows you to see both designs at the same time. This is the default display option.

The right side shows what that object look will look like
after
the merge (the branch).
Overlay
Overlay
allows you to compare the before and after by placing them on top of one another.
The layer underneath is the element
before

object.
