==================================================

Before you start
Who can use this feature
Available on
all plans
Requires
can edit
access to a file to adjust layers and prototype from the properties panel
Requires
can view
access to a file to comment, explore file and layer properties, and export layers from the properties panel
In Figma Design, a file has three main interface elements that are detached from the canvas:
The
navigation panel
on the left side of the screen
The
toolbar
at the bottom of the screen
The properties panel on the right side of the screen
In this article, we're going to explore the properties panel.
How the properties panel changes based on your access to a file
The properties panel has different capabilities depending on your level of access to a file, and your
seat type
Edit access
: Edit the design properties of layers, and add prototype flows and interactions
View-only access
: View and search comments, inspect layer properties and code output, and export
Use the properties panel with edit access
There are two tabs available in the properties panel when you have edit access to a file:
Design
and
Prototype
Tip
: You can add labels to the properties panel to make it clearer what each property does. To turn on labels, click the
dropdown menu next to the 100% zoom percentage in the properties panel and select
Property labels
Design
The
Design
tab lets you view, add, remove or change the properties of objects within your design.
If nothing is selected on the canvas, you'll be able to do the following from the
Design
tab:
Access styles and variables that are local to the file
Update the background color of the canvas
Export the entire page
When you select a layer, you can access many different property controls for editing the layer. For example:
Alignment, rotation, and position
Frame size and orientation
Corner radius
Constraints
Layout guides
Component properties
Instance
Auto layout
Blend Modes
Text
Fill
Stroke
Effects
Export settings
Prototype
Use the
Prototype
tab to start building prototypes. Select any object to begin, then:
Add a
flow starting point
: A flow is a path users take through the network of connected frames that make up your prototype. Add a starting point to choose the first frame of the journey.
Add an
interaction
: Open up the
Interaction Details
modal, where you can define the trigger, action, and any animations for the interaction.
Define
scroll behavior
: Select how the prototype responds to scrolling.
Show
prototype settings
: Allows you to adjust the device and background of your prototype.
Tip
: You can also add interactions directly on the canvas by selecting the
Prototype
tab, then clicking and dragging connections between objects.

Use the properties panel with view-only access
People with
can view
access to a file, or who have a View seat on a paid plan, have two tabs in the properties panel:
Comment
and
Properties
View-only access is great for people who don't need to edit designs or for developers who need to access designs, but don't need the full suite of Dev Mode features. People with this access to a file can collaborate on designs, view design properties, copy basic code, and export assets.
Comment
Select
Comment
in the right sidebar to add new comments or view existing ones. You can use comments to add or respond to feedback, collaborate, and iterate faster—all from the original design file.
From the
Comment
tab, you can see all the existing comments in a file. Or, find a particular comment or set of comments within a file:
Type a keyword in the Search field to find a particular comment.
Use the Filter to view comments by when they were posted or see only the ones you haven’t read yet. Here, you can filter to only view a certain set of comments.
Learn more about
adding comments to a Figma Design file
viewing and manage comments.
Properties
The
Properties
tab of the right sidebar lets you inspect particular layers on the canvas, as well as export designs.
To begin, select a layer on the canvas. You can do this by either selecting the element on the canvas itself or by selecting it from the
Layers
panel on the left sidebar. You can select any type of layer, such as a shape, text, group, or frame.
Under
Properties
, you’ll see the name of the selected layer and details about it, such as its layout and colors.
Right-click the layer on the canvas to:
Copy the layer
Copy/paste as code (CSS, iOS, or Android), SVG, PNG, copy the link, or copy its properties
Select a different layer within the layer you selected
Looking to measure distances between objects? You can use keyboard shortcuts to quickly access spacing and padding information.

At the bottom of the
Properties
tab, you can add an export configuration to export designs in a variety of file formats and sizes. Exporting helps you share content with others, move content between tools, and save copies of your designs outside Figma.
