With Figma AI, you can generate and populate realistic text in your designs. This allows you to save time populating placeholder content for repetitive elements like lists, posts, cards, and tables.
Note:
This article is about the
Replace content
feature. For information on other text-related AI features, check out the
Rewrite, translate, and shorten text
article.
How it works
Replace content uses AI to replace placeholder text with realistic text content. You can replace content on a single item, or on multiple duplicate items.
For example, let’s say you’re designing a professional networking app and have a card with text layers for a person’s name, title, and bio. Use
Replace content
to replace the filler text (”name”, “title”) with real examples (”Jules”, “Product Designer”).
Note:
You can’t use
Replace content
to generate or replace placeholder images for content. To generate images using Figma AI, use
Make image
instead.
Use Replace content
To use
Replace content
in Figma Design or Figma Sites:
Select one or multiple objects with text.
From the
Actions
menu, select
Replace content
Enter a prompt to provide additional context.
Click
Replace content
Tip:
If you duplicate a layer with with placeholder text multiple times, a banner will pop up with a suggestion to use
Replace content
in the duplicated layers, updating the placeholder text to realistic examples.
