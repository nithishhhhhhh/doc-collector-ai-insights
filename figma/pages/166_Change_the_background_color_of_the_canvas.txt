The canvas in Figma is the backdrop on which all of your frames, groups, and other layers live.
The default background color of the canvas is determined by your current theme—light or dark—when you create a file.
In light mode, the background defaults to light-gray:
#F5F5F5
In dark mode, the background defaults to an off-black color:
#1E1E1E
When you create a new page in your file, the new page inherits its background color from the current page’s background color.
Note
: Changing the background color of the canvas sets the color for everyone who has access to the file.
To change the background color:
Deselect any layers on the canvas.
From the
Page
section of the properties panel on the right side of the screen, click the color fill to select a new color. You can also enter a specific hex value if you prefer.
If needed, set the opacity on the background by clicking
100%
and entering a new value.
Tip
: You can toggle the visibility of the background color by clicking the
Hide
icon.
Note
: The canvas background color cannot be changed while in Dev Mode.
