==================================================

Who can use this feature
Images are available on
all plans
Video is available on
all paid plans
Anyone with
can edit
access to a file can upload images and videos
Add images and video to your design files to incorporate photography, screenshots, or other visual assets to your designs.
Supported file types include:
JPG, PNG, HEIC, WebP, TIFF (only available on Safari), and GIF raster image files
MP4, MOV, and WebM video files
Note:
When a Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) is imported into a Figma Design file, the SVG is no longer treated as an image. While raster images are applied to layers as fill properties, vector images are converted to
vector layers
that you can edit, just like other shapes drawn in Figma.
Figma doesn't have a specific layer type for raster images and videos. Instead, they are a type of
fill
. This allows you to add images and videos to any shape or vector network.
View and update image and video fills in the
Fill
section of the right sidebar. Figma will show a thumbnail in the swatch and an
Image
Video
, or
GIF
label.
Raster images and videos added to the canvas create a rectangle with the asset set to the object's fill. They can be identified in the left sidebar with the following:
Static images will have an
image icon next to its layer name
Videos and GIFs will have a
video icon next to its layer name
If you add them to an existing object, Figma uses the layer icon and description of the original layer.
Note:
Figma downsizes images with a width or height
larger than 4096 pixels
. This scales the image's original dimensions proportionally, so the longest edge is less than 4096 pixels.
Sometimes, Figma needs to decode and convert an image before adding it to the file. For this reason, we can't guarantee that all file metadata will be preserved.
Add images and videos to files
As raster images and videos are fills, you can add them to any vector or shape. This gives you greater flexibility and control.
There are a number of ways you can add images to design files:
Drag and drop image files from your computer onto the canvas
Import static images into the file browser
Add images and videos in bulk
Use the color picker to upload an image or video
Copy and paste an image between objects and from your clipboard
You can also
add video
and
animated GIFs
to your prototypes. GIFs only playback when viewing designs and prototypes in presentation view.
Edit images
There are lots of ways to edit or adjust images:
Scale, rotate and adjust the dimensions of any layers with images
Crop and re-position images applied to layers
Adjust the image options including the fill mode, rotation and blend modes
Includes images in
styles
and
components
Apply
masks
to only show a part of the image
Make
adjustments to images
like changing the hue, saturation, or contrast
