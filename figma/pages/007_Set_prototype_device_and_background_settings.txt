play your prototype
using inline preview or presentation view.
Device
Figma has a number of popular device presets. The dimensions of your prototype frames will define what options are available.
Frame preset
: If you used a
frame preset
, Figma will select a device that matches that preset. You can select another device if desired. For example, if you use the iPhone 15 Pro Max frame preset, Figma will select the iPhone 15 Pro Max as the device too.
Presentation view
: All device type frame presets are available
Inline preview
: Only mobile device (phone, watch, and tablet) frame presets are available
Custom Size (Fit)
: A custom size automatically scales the design, so that it fits within the screen you are viewing the prototype on. Only applicable in
presentation view
—if you select
Custom size
, you won’t see a device when playing a prototype in
inline preview
Presentation (Full)
: Displays the prototype at a size that allows it to be displayed on the screen in its entirety. Only applicable in
presentation view
—if you select
Presentation
, you won’t see a device when playing a prototype in
inline preview
Orientation
Control the orientation of the device in presentation view. Choose from:
Portrait
Landscape
Note:
It's not possible to switch between orientations within a prototype. This is something to bear in mind if you have frames in your prototype across both orientations.
Model
Depending on the device you selected, you can specify a certain model. For example, the iPhone 15 Pro Max comes in four different colors.
Preview
View a preview of how the device will look in presentation view.
Background
Choose a custom background color to appear behind your selected device in
presentation view
For example, you might set the background to a neutral color to help users focus on the content, or use a brand color for extra polish.
