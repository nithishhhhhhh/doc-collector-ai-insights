access can update stroke properties
Strokes are a collection of properties you can apply to layers in design files. You can think of strokes as the visual representation of a vector network's path. Use strokes to:
Add outlines around
shapes
vector networks
, or
boolean operations
Create lines and arrows
Add borders to
images
The stroke properties let you control the appearance of a stroke's with color, weight, distribution, side, width and end points.
Note:
When you select an object, Figma applies stroke properties to the entire layer. You can use
vector edit mode
to adjust stroke properties for individual points.
Stroke properties
View and adjust stroke properties in the
Stroke
section of the right sidebar.
Paints
Paint is the main property you’ll use to define the stroke. You can apply more than one paint (color) to a stroke. This includes gradient and image paints. Paints must share the same weight, position, and style properties.
Use the
color picker
to select a paint type, value, and opacity.
Click
to add another paint to the current selection.
Select
to toggle the visibility of each paint.
Select
to open the Style picker. From there you can apply a color style or create a new one from the current selection.
Select
to remove the stroke from the selected layer.
Position
Figma lets you define where to apply the stroke on the layer’s path. Choose from
Inside
Outside
, or
Center
. The default option for most shape layers is
Inside
, except lines which are set to center.
The SVG format only supports center stroke. This is something to consider if you plan on exporting the layer as an SVG.
When you export a layer with inside or outside stroke to SVG, Figma will “simplify” the stroke. This makes an inside or outside stroke look like a center stroke. This won't affect the appearance of the exported object, but it will impact the complexity of the SVG code.

Tip:
Preview stroke positions and styles on the canvas by hovering over each option on the dropdown before selecting it.
Weight
Use the
field to select the weight of the stroke, in pixels. Enter a value, or focus on the field and scroll through values using your mouse or trackpad.
Note:
Figma doesn’t include the stroke weight in the layer’s dimensions. This means you won’t see the stroke included in the layer’s dimensions in the
Inspect
panel.
Individual strokes
By default, Figma applies the stroke properties to all sides of a layer. If your layer is a rectangle, frame, or component/instance, you’ll also have a
Stroke per side
property.
Use the
Stroke per side
property to choose which side or sides to apply the stroke.
All
(default)
Top
Bottom
Left
Right
Custom
: to choose which sides to apply stroke. Custom also allows you to set a different stroke weight per side.
Tip!
Rectangles include any shapes created using the
rectangle tool, frames, and components and instances that use frames.
Custom strokes per side
When you select custom, you’ll see four individual fields in the
Stroke
section. Use the fields to adjust the weight for each side independently. To remove a stroke from a side, set the weight to
You can use individual strokes to create common design elements and patterns:
Apply a single stroke to the top or bottom of a row in a table
Show a horizontal line underneath a section header or divider
Apply a border to only three sides of an element
Add a color block to the left side of a card or task element
End points
Add styling to the end points of any open ended paths. The end point property will show up in two different locations, depending on the vector path you have selected.
Only two end points
If the layer is an open vector path, you can set the endpoints at the start and end of the vector path in the main
Stroke
section. For example: line and arrow shapes.
Use the two fields to set the
cap or tip style ↓
for the start (left) and end (right) endpoints.
More than two endpoints
If you have a closed vector path or shape—or an open path with more than two end points—you’ll find the end points settings in the
Advanced stroke menu
instead.
If you have the entire layer selected, you can use the
End points
property to set the same tip or cap style for all endpoints.
To edit them independently, you need to select each end point in vector edit mode:
With the layer selected, press
Enter
Return
to open
vector edit mode →
Select a single end point. You can identify the selected end point by the blue circle with a white stroke.
Select the
in the
Stroke
section of the right sidebar to open the
Advanced stroke
menu.
Update the
End point
property.
The
Advanced stroke
menu will stay open, allowing you to select another end point in the canvas and update the end point again.
Cap and tip endpoints
Choose from a selection of caps or tips to add to your end points:
None
: No cap or tip is added to the end of the path. The end are square, without adding any length to the path.
Round (default)
: Adds a cap half the stroke weight, as well as rounding the end point of the path to 50% the width.
Square
: Adds a cap half the stroke weight, while squaring the end point of the path.
Line arrow
: Two 45-degree lines to either side of the end point(s). The line arrow uses the same stroke weight as the path itself. You cannot change the length of the arrow head lines.
Triangle arrow
: Triangle arrowhead to both end points. You'll need to enter
vector edit mode →
to apply an arrow to only one end of the path.
Reverse triangle:
Reversed or flipped version of the triangle arrow, with the arrow pointing inward towards the path.
Diamond arrow:
Adds a solid diamond shaped tip to the end point.
Stroke types
You can use the advanced stroke settings to further customize how a stroke looks. To access these settings, navigate to the
Stroke
section in the right sidebar and select
Advanced stroke settings
Basic stroke
You can use the basic stroke settings to create a dashed or dotted stroke.
Note:
Figma starts and ends every dashed line with a half-length dash. You can use
Outline stroke
from the right-click menu to convert the stroke to a vector object. This will allow you to use edit object mode to remove or extend the half-dash.
Dashed
Create a uniform dashed line.
In the
Stroke
panel, select
to open the
Advanced stroke
menu.
Select the
Dashed

Enter the length you want for the
Dash
, in pixels.
Enter the length of the
Gap
between dashes, in pixels.
Choose the type of cap for the dash:
None
Round
Square
Dotted
Create a dotted line.
In the
Stroke
panel, use the dropdown to change the stroke position to

Custom
Create a dashed or dotted line with a custom pattern.
In the
Stroke
panel, select
to open the
Advanced stroke
menu.
Set the
Stroke style
setting to the
Custom
option.
Use the following syntax in the
Dashes
setting to define the dash pattern
dash, gap, dash, gap
...
Select the
Dash cap
you want to use.
For example: We want to represent the letter
in morse code
..-.
as a custom dash pattern. We’d enter the following in the
Dashes
setting
10, 20, 10, 20, 80, 20, 10, 100
Brush stroke
Brush strokes give your selection an organic, hand-painted look. Use the
Brush
tab in the
Advanced stroke settings
to browse through available brush styles, including custom brushes you’ve created. Hover your cursor over a style to preview how it will look on your selection. Once you apply a brush stroke, you can use the
Direction
setting to determine which direction the stroke will flow.
Note:
Brush strokes can only be positioned in the center of a stroke.
Dynamic stroke
Dynamic strokes give your selection’s stroke a hand-drawn, bumpy look. You can use the
Dynamic stroke
settings to configure the stroke’s appearance:
Frequency:
Determines the number of bumps in the stroke
Wiggle:
Determines how large the bumps appear
Smoothen:
Determines how jagged the bumps are
Note:
Dynamic strokes can only be positioned in the center of a stroke.
Join and miter angle
Define how lines join within a path or vector network. Adjust the joins in an entire path, or enter
vector edit mode
to select a single anchor point in the path. Choose from:
Miter:
Create a sharp point, like an arrow, where the two paths meet.
Bevel:
Cut off the sharp point to create a flat edge.
Rounded:
Round the point where two paths meet to soften to join.
Use the
Miter angle
setting to control the angle at which two joined lines bevel. For example: for a miter of 90°, any angle ≤ 90° will bevel; anything > 90° will create a sharp point.

Note:
Figma doesn’t include the stroke weight in a layer’s dimensions. You won’t see the stroke weight included in a layer’s dimensions in the right sidebar.
This is something to consider when translating designs to code, especially for layers with center and outside stroke.
In an auto layout frame, you can choose to include stroke in the layer’s total dimensions. When included, the layer’s dimensions in the right sidebar will include the weights of any strokes.

Styles and strokes
You can only create and apply
color styles
to strokes. There isn't a way to save a stroke's other properties, like weight and position, as a style.
When you apply a color style to a stroke, you can still adjust the other properties. This includes the weight and distribution, as well as any advanced stroke properties like caps, join, and dashes.
Apply color styles to strokes
Select the layer you want to update.
In the
Stroke
section of the right-hand panel, click the
style icon.
Use the style picker to select the relevant color style.
Adjust any of the other properties of the stroke, as desired.
Scale and resize strokes
Strokes respond differently based on how you resize them.
Resize the object if you want to retain a stroke's weight, while adjusting the object's dimensions. Hover over the stroke's bounding box until the
cursor appears, then drag to resize.
Use the
scale
tool to scale the stroke properties along with the object's dimensions.

Convert strokes to vector objects
Outline stroke allows you to convert strokes into vector objects. This will take each path in the object and turn it into a single editable shape.
This will allow you to:
Remove or extend half-dashes
Create custom shapes and edit them in vector edit mode
Combine multiple paths into a single object
Scale vector objects uniformly
Note:
It's not possible to convert a vector object back into a stroke, unless you undo the action. Use the keyboard shortcuts to undo:
Mac:
Command
Windows:
Control
Outline stroke
Right-click the layer and select
Outline stroke
, or use keyboard shortcut:
Mac:
⌘ Command
⌥ Option
Window:
Control
Alt
Figma will convert the path into a vector object and apply any paints you had as a stroke as a fill.
You can see how that vector object looks in vector edit mode. Press
Enter
Return
, or click
Edit object
in the toolbar to edit the vector object.
Note:
If you prefer to use
⌘ Command
Control
⇧ Shift
to toggle outline stroke, open the main menu in the top left-corner and go to
Preferences
Use old shortcuts for outlines
. This setting will also change the keyboard shortcut for
