How it works
Add interactions
with Figma AI lets you create interactions and connections between frames in your selection. For example:
Create simple flows between a selection of top-level frames
Add interactions to back or next buttons
Link to individual frames from a navigation menu
This is helpful if you want to quickly build a basic prototype flow from your designs. You can always customize each interaction further or add more interactions to your prototype.
Consistent layer naming can help improve Figma AI output. Learn how to
rename layers with Figma AI
