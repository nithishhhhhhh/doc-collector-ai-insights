==================================================

Accessible prototypes in Figma allow you to navigate through content using a screen reader. To use accessibility mode in a prototype, you’ll first need to install a supported screen reader.
Accessible prototypes are only available in the desktop browser and on the Figma desktop app. Accessibility mode does not work for mobile or mobile web prototypes.

Activate accessibility mode
After a screen reader is installed and enabled, you can activate accessibility mode in a Figma prototype a few different ways:
Keyboard controls
Press
Tab
to focus on the hidden
Skip to content
button. This button is the first interactive item on the page.
Press
Enter
to turn on accessibility mode for the current prototyping session.
A self-dismissing message that reads “Now adapting content for screen readers” displays at the bottom of the page. If enabled, your screen reader will also verbalize this message.
Note:
The
Skip to content
button is also available in screen reader menus, such as VoiceOver’s Form Controls rotor.

Figma Design to HTML mapping
While in accessibility mode, Figma Design elements are translated to HTML or HyperText Markup Language. Screen readers interpret HTML tags to understand the content and sections of a document, as well as which elements are available for a user to interact with on a page. Semantic HTML tags also allow a screen reader to communicate content that may be highlighted visually to a user.
When considering how your Figma Design elements translate to HTML:
The prototype actions
Navigate to
and
Open link
are seen by screen readers as links; all other actions are seen by screen readers as buttons
Any element in a prototype with an
On click
interaction is seen by the screen reader as an accessible button or link, depending on its triggered action
The screen reader navigates through links and lists within design text
Ordered and unordered lists are read as structured and nested lists
Inline links are seen by screen readers as accessible links
Any shapes with an image fill appear as an image and have their alt text populated with the layer’s name
Top-level frames, components, and component instances become labelled sections using layer names as the accessible label
Using
Tab
to navigate follows the layer order of your prototype. If your content isn't read in the order you expect, open the Figma Design file and
change the layer order in the left sidebar
. For frames with auto layout, navigation follows the order of the layout—either top to bottom or left to right.
