Apply effects to layers to enhance your designs.
Effects can serve various aesthetic and functional purposes.
For example, adding a shadow to a button can help bring attention to it and signal that the element is interactive.
In Figma, there are six types of effects:
Drop shadow
Inner shadow
Layer blur
Background blur
Noise
Texture
Each layer can have up to eight drop shadows, eight inner shadows, one layer blur, two noise effects, one texture effect, and one background blur. You can also combine effects with
blend modes
and
fills
to create a variety of styles and effects.

Shadow effects
There are two types of shadow effects in Figma: drop shadow and inner shadow.
Tip
Both shadow effects translate to the
box-shadow
property in CSS. Shadow effects on text layers translate to
text-shadow
in CSS. View CSS properties for your selection in
Dev mode
Drop shadow
Drop shadows are a great way to add depth and dimension to your designs. You can do this by creating the shadow of an object on a surface behind it.
Drop shadows can vary in opacity, depending on the effect you want to create.
Use drop shadows to:
Create distance between objects
Set the direction of a light source
Make your designs stand out against a background
Make objects look three-dimensional
Stylize text and icons
Add borders around a layer or object
Inner shadow
Like drop shadows, inner shadows allow you to create depth within two-dimensional designs.
Instead of creating a shadow behind your selection, inner shadows are applied within the layer or object. This contains the shadow within the layer's bounds.
Use inner shadows to:
Create depth within text
Make an object look recessed or indented
Show an active or clicked state of a button
Tip:
Preview effects on the canvas by hovering over each option in the menu before selecting.
Show drop shadows through transparent layers
By default, Figma doesn't display drop shadows through transparent areas of the layer. If you want to display drop shadows through an object:
Make sure the layer meets at least one of the following criteria:
Has only fills with less than 100% opacity
Has a stroke, but no fill
Has a fill or stroke with a blend mode that isn't
Normal
Or, has a
center or outside stroke
with less than 100% opacity
Click the effects icon to open the shadow's property menu.
Check the
Show behind transparent areas
checkbox.
Note:
Inner shadows don't support
show behind transparent areas
Shadow spread
Shadow spread is only supported on rectangles, ellipses, frames, and components.
To apply a spread shadow to a frame or component, you must have:
Clip content
enabled
visible fill
with at least 1% opacity
Caution:
The Figma Plugin API allows you to set a spread value for any object. Figma will not apply the spread value in the canvas, if spread isn't supported on that type of object.
Add shadow effects
You can apply shadow effects to frames, groups, components, or individual layers.
Select the layer or object from the canvas or
Layers
tab of the left sidebar.
Click the
Effects
section in the right sidebar. The
Drop shadow
effect is selected by default. Use the dropdown to switch to
Inner shadow
Click the
Effect settings
icon to adjust the shadow's settings.
Offset the drop shadow along the x axis (horizontal). Use with Y offset to set the direction of the light source.
Offset the drop shadow along the y axis (vertical). Use with X offset to set the direction of the light source.
Fill
: Apply a paint using the color picker and set an opacity for the shadow
Blur:
Adjust the blur or feathering of the shadow. Increase the blur to soften the shadow and blend it with the background. Decrease the blur to create a sharper contrast.
Spread:
Adjust the size of the shadow to represent the distance between the foreground and background objects. See:
Shadow spread
Tip
You can copy a layer's effect settings to paste on another layer or object from the
Effects
section of the right sidebar.

Blur effects
Caution
Depending on your device and internet connection, files with a large number of blur effects can lead to reduced performance. Background blurs are typically the slowest effect to render. To temporarily improve performance, you can toggle the visibility of individual effects.
Layer blur
Blurs help to imply action or movement, or create the illusion of depth in two-dimensional designs. Use layer blur to:
Anonymize information
Soften or detract focus from the background
Create abstract backgrounds from photographs and images
Replicate camera depth and other photographic effects like bokeh
There are two types of layer blurs:
Uniform
: Applies the same blur across the entire layer
Progressive
: Allows you to control the blur’s size, direction, and intensity where it starts and ends
Background blur
When you apply a background blur to a layer, Figma will blur any layers behind your selection on the canvas. You can think of this like a drop shadow, but instead of the layer creating a shadow, it creates a blur.
You can use background blur to soften or detract focus. This draws attention away from the background and to the selected layer.
Background blur is commonly used for interactive menus in iOS. But you can also use background blur to obscure text or personal information in a screenshot.
There are two types of background blurs:
Uniform
: Applies the same blur across the entire layer
Progressive
: Allows you to control the blur’s size, direction, and intensity where it starts and ends
To‌ see a background blur, your selection will need to have an appropriate opacity. You can set opacity for layers with background blur for any value
between .10 and 99.99%
You may have to adjust the opacity of your layers to get the desired effect. If you set a layer's opacity to 100%, you won't be able to see the background blur at all.
Note
It's only possible to add one layer or background blur to a layer or object.
If you have other layers with background blur applied, Figma will ignore them instead of multiplying the existing background blur.
Apply blur effects
You can apply blur effects to frames, groups, components, or individual layers. It's only possible to add one layer or background blur to a layer or object.
Select the layer or object from the canvas or
Layers
tab of the left sidebar.
Click the
Effects
section in the right sidebar. The
Drop shadow
effect is selected by default. Use the dropdown to switch to
Layer Blur
Background
Blur
Click the
Effect settings
icon to adjust the blur value.
Adjust the layer opacity, if needed.
You can also create Styles for shadow and blur effects. This allows you to save those settings and use them across your design files. Learn how to
create effect styles
Noise
The noise effect applies random pixels to a layer, giving it a subtle grainy texture that mimics the visual characteristics of film photography.
Apply noise effects
You can apply noise effects to any layer type. It’s only possible to add two noise effects per object.
To apply a noise effect:
Select the layer.
Click the
plus in the
Effects
section to add a new effect.
Choose
Noise
from the dropdown menu.
Open the
Effect settings
menu to configure the effect:
Number of colors:
Choose between
Mono
(one),
Duo
(two), or
Multi
(many) to determine how many colors will be included in the noise
Noise size
: Adjust the scale of the noise pixels
Density
: Set the concentration of noise pixels
Color (Mono or Duo only):
Choose the desired color and opacity for the noise pixels
Opacity (Multi only):
Set the opacity for the noise pixels
Texture
The texture effect distresses an object's edge, creating a roughened effect.
Apply texture effects
You can apply texture effects to any layer type. It’s only possible to apply one texture effect per object.
To apply a texture effect:
Select the layer.
Click the
plus in the
Effects
section to add a new effect.
Choose
Texture
from the dropdown menu.
Open the
Effect settings
menu to configure the effect:
Size:
Set the scale of the textured effect
Radius
: Adjust to determine how far past the layer’s boundary the effect will spread
Clip to shape:
Enable this option to limit the texture effect to within the layer’s boundary. While the texture itself will be confined to the shape, drop shadows will still interact with the clipped texture, creating a textured shadow effect.
Reorder effects
If a selection has multiple effects applied, you click and drag the handles to reorder the effects. How effects are ordered in the
Effects
section impacts how the selection is
rendered
Render order
The way Figma renders a selection’s effects depends on the types of effects applied, their order in the
Effects
section of the right sidebar, and whether the selection is a layer or a group. Masks are considered groups in this context. The differences in group and layer shadows are most obvious on layers that overlap. When the shapes don’t overlap, they will appear the same.
Render order for layers
Top:
Layer blur, noise, texture (applied in their specified order)
Stroke paints
Inner shadow
Fill paints

Bottom
: Background blur
Render order for groups
Top:

How layer blurs and unclipped textures impact rendering
Layer blurs and unclipped texture effects extend past a selection’s boundary. There are some things to keep in mind when applying layer blurs or unclipped textures to a selection:
Noise and clipped textures
Noise and clipped textures normally do not extend past a selection’s boundary but can do so if placed above a layer blur or unclipped texture in the
Effects
section.
For example, to enable a noise effect to reach the edge of a drop shadow, you can place a layer blur or unclipped texture in between them in the
Effects
section.
Blend modes on drop shadows
Typically, blend modes on drop shadows interact with content behind the layer with the drop shadow applied. Applying a layer blur or unclipped texture to the same layer will isolate the blend mode, causing it to only interact with other effects on the layer itself.
Blend modes on fills and strokes
Typically, blend modes on fills and strokes will interact with content behind the layer. Applying a layer blur or unclipped texture to the layer will isolate the blend mode, causing it to only interact with other fills and strokes on the selected layer. You can apply the blend mode to the layer itself in the
Appe
rance
section of the right sidebar to enable the blend mode to interact with other content on the canvas.
