Figma supports OpenType features
across all fonts, but not all fonts will support the same OpenType features. Typeface creators have full control over which OpenType features they support. They could be popular features - like kerning, case, or numerical figures. Or, custom features like alternative characters or glyphs, and stylistic alternatives.
You can explore OpenType features of your selected font from the
Typography
section of the properties panel. Click
to open the Type menu and select the
Details
tab.
You can hover over an OpenType property to preview of the feature. If a font doesn't support a specific OpenType feature, it will be greyed out in the menu.
You can also access these OpenType features in
