==================================================

Who can use this feature
Available on
all paid plans
Note:
Figma’s AI features are currently free while
in beta
, but usage limits may apply. When made generally available, Figma AI will become a paid feature. We’ll update you on pricing before that happens.
To make improvements to Figma's AI features over time, we will be training models that better understand design concepts and patterns, and Figma’s internal formats and structure through Figma content. Admins can control whether their teams use these features and whether they participate in content training.

How AI management works for admins
Admins have control over AI use and content training, which they can adjust with two new settings. Admins can turn these settings on or off at anytime. These settings control:
Access to AI features
For all paid plans: AI features are set to ‘on’ by default
Content training
For Professional, content training is set to ‘on’ by default — admins can opt out
For Organization and Enterprise, content training is set to ‘off’ by default
These are team-level settings for Professional plans and organization-level settings for Organization and Enterprise plans.
Our customer agreements with Organization and Enterprise are typically more complex and include specific requirements and restrictions, which is why we’ve chosen a different default setting for those plans. Additionally, these two new settings will default to ‘off’ for teams that turned off "Figma and FigJam AI" prior to June 26, 2024.
Adjust access to AI features across Figma
Note:
The
AI features
toggle applies to all AI features across Figma products, including
Figma Make
Separately, Figma Make has a toggle where admins can enable or disable Figma Make publishing.

Admins can adjust the AI features setting at any time and any changes are applied immediately. When the
AI features
toggle is off, users within that team or organization cannot access or use any AI features in any of the team or organization’s files. When it’s on, users can use AI features that they have access to.

Data privacy and security
We know how important your data is to you, your company, and your clients. Our model development process is designed to protect your privacy and confidential information.
We take additional steps to train our models so that they learn general design patterns and Figma-specific concepts and tools—not your content, concepts, and ideas. For example, we de-identify content and redact sensitive information including from text and images.

Frequently asked questions
I'm a
Figma for Education
Figma for Government
account. What does this mean for me?
AI features and settings will not be enabled for users who are a part of an Education plan. If you have any questions, please contact
education@figma.com
Organizations using the
Figma for Government
solution will not have AI features or settings enabled.
Figma does not use
any data from Figma for Education or Figma for Government accounts to train AI models.
I turned off AI features prior to June 26, 2024. What happens to my settings?
Content training is ‘off’ by default for teams who turned off the “Figma and FigJam AI” setting prior to June 26, 2024, no matter the plan type. The AI features setting will remain off.
How does the content training setting work and what happens after I turn it off?
Content helps us build better, more useful experiences, but sharing it with Figma for AI training is optional. Admins can control whether or not content is used for AI model training with the content training setting. For Starter and Professional accounts, this is a team-level setting.
Content training went into effect on August 15, 2024. If an admin turns off content training after this date, new content and edits will not be used to train AI models.
What 3rd party models does Figma’s AI use?
We work with multiple vendors, such as OpenAI, to operationalize, build and fine-tune AI models, as well as process data to power Figma’s AI features. You can find the list of the sub-processors used to power AI features
here
Do you use content from my drafts to train AI models?
Drafts organized into teams are treated the same as other files in that team and will only be used to train AI models if content training is set to ‘on’. Content training is an admin setting. If you prefer that Figma not use content in your drafts to train AI models, please:
Turn off content training or ask your admin to do so
Move your drafts into a Starter or paid team where content training is set to ‘off’
How does Figma protect my privacy and confidential information?
We know how important your data is to you, your company, and your clients. Our model development process is designed to protect your privacy and confidential information.
For all customer data, we:
Encrypt all data at rest and in transit
Use security measures designed to protect against unauthorized access to customer data
Enforce tailored permissions and user access controls around who can view and access your data
When working with 3rd party companies to process data, we:
Do not permit 3rd party model providers to use data that customers upload or create on the Figma platform for training their own models
Limit how long vendors can store data. OpenAI and our other 3rd party model providers store data temporarily, or in some cases not at all, in order to process requests and enable AI features
We take additional steps to train our models so that they learn general design patterns and Figma-specific concepts and tools—not your content, concepts, and ideas. For example, we de-identify content and redact sensitive information including from text and images.
