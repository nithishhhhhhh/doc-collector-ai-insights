Who can use this feature
Supported on
any plan
Anyone with
can edit
access to a design file can use shape tools
Shapes make up the majority of your layers in any given design. Use the following shape tools as your building blocks:
Rectangle
Line
Arrow
Ellipse
Polygon
Star
You can access these tools from the
Shape tools
menu in the toolbar. Click the arrow next to the
Rectangle
to open the menu.
You can use the following shortcuts when working with shapes:
Hold down
Shift
when dragging to create perfect squares, circles and polygons.
Hold down
Option
Alt
to create and resize shapes from their center.
Hold down
Shift
and
Option
Alt
at the same time to do both actions.
Note:
For designs that require unique or complex shapes, you can build your own vector networks using the
Pen
tool.

Rectangles
Use the
Rectangle
tool to create both rectangles and squares.
Select the
Rectangle
tool from the toolbar, or press
Click on a spot in the canvas and drag to create the rectangle. You’ll see the rectangle’s dimensions underneath the bottom edge.
There will be a handle in each corner of the shape, this allows you to resize the shape as you see fit.
Adjust corner radius
In addition to the regular handles, rectangles also have four circle handles on the inside of every corner. These handles allow you to adjust the corner to round the corners of the rectangle.

Lines
The
Line
tool allows you to create lines in any direction. Lines are an effective way of breaking up content within a design, or simulating CSS borders.
Select the
Line
tool from the shape tools or press
Click on a spot in the canvas and drag in any direction to create the line.
You can make any changes to its appearance in the
Stroke
section of the right sidebar. This includes the color, position, weight, style, and end point tips or caps.

Create dashed lines
You can specify both the length of the dash and the gap between dashes.
Draw or select the line.
In the
Stroke
section of the right sidebar, select
to open the
Advanced stroke settings
menu.
Enter the length you want in the
Dash
and the
Gap
fields.
Arrows
The
Arrow
tool allows you to draw one-sided and two-sided arrows. You can customize the tips or caps of the arrow’s end points.
Select the
Arrow
tool from the shape tools menu, or use the shortcut
⇧ Shift
Click on a spot in the canvas and drag in any direction to create the arrow.
Like the line tool, you can make adjustments to the
Stroke
properties.

Ellipses and circles
Use the
Ellipse
tool to draw both ovals and circles. These can be used as they are, or manipulated to create custom shapes with curved lines.
Select the
Ellipse
tool from the shape tools menu, or press
Select a spot in the canvas and drag in any direction to create the ellipse. The shape's dimensions will be shown in blue underneath the layer.
There will be a blue bounding box around the ellipse, with a handle in each corner. This allows you to resize the shape.
Tip:
Use the ellipse tool to create other shapes, like semi-circles, pie charts, rings, donuts and semi-circular rings.

Polygons
The
Polygon
tool allows you to draw an enclosed shape that is made up of any number of straight lines.
The default shape for the polygon tool is a triangle, but you can add extra points to the object to create your own custom polygons.
Select the
Polygon
tool from the shape menu.
Select a location in the canvas and drag to create the polygon. The shape's dimensions will be shown in blue underneath the object.
The blue bounding box around the shape has a handle in each corner. This allows you to resize the shape as you see fit.
Enter
Edit object
mode by double-clicking on the polygon layer. This allows you to add additional points to the polygon and manipulate each point individually:
You can round the corners of a polygon too. Hover over the handle in the corner until the
radius
is shown. Click and drag the handle towards the center of the object to round the corners.
Polygons and bounding boxes
You may have noticed that when we drew our polygon, in this case a triangle, the blue bounding box around the shape is below the bottom of the shape.
This allows the bounding box to remain a consistent shape or size, when additional points are added to the polygon. To snap the bounding box to the shape's true boundary, you can
flatten
the shape.
Stars
The
Star
tool creates polygons that are arranged in a star shape. When you create a star layer, the default will be a five pointed star with ten sides.
Select the
Star
tool from the shape tools menu.
Select a position in the canvas and drag in any direction to create the star.
You’ll now have three handles you can use to manipulate the star:
Count
: How many points there are to the star. The minimum is three and the maximum is 60.
Ratio
: The distance of the inner points of the star from the center. This is represented as percentage of the star's diameter.
Radius
: Allows you to round the points of the star.
