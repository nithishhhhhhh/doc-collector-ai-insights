guide.
When a design reuses a component across multiple screens, you can prototype at the speed of light.
If you
add a prototype connection
from a main component, and use instances of that component in your designs, the prototyping connections of the instances will be inherited from the main component.
Use inherited prototype connections to connect:
A mobile app tab bar placed at the bottom of multiple screens
An arrow button to
navigate back
to the previous screen
A website footer or navigation menu
Any component used for navigation that appears frequently throughout your design
Add connections from main components
To prototype with main components:
Check that the main component is on the same page as the designs that contain the instances. Components from
team libraries
can't be prototyped this way.
Use instance(s) of the component in your designs.
Click the
Prototype
tab at the top of the right sidebar.
Click and drag from the
to create at least one connection from the main component.
In the example below, the mobile app design has a persistent navigation bar at the bottom of each screen. We can connect a tab in the main component to its destination screen, and all instances of the navigation bar inherit the same interaction. Without a main component, we would need to connect each tab of every navigation bar individually.
Note:
Figma won't display the inherited connections on the canvas by default. Select the instance to view its inherited connections.
