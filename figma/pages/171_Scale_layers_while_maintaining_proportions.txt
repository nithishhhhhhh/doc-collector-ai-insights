==================================================

Before you Start
Who can use this feature

Users with
edit access
to a Figma Design file can resize objects with the scale tool
Use the scale tool to proportionally resize layers and objects. This tool preserves aspect ratios and ignores
constraints
of any nested layers in order to scale them proportionally. Any blurs or strokes will scale as well.
Note:
To preserve the aspect ratio on a layer without scaling it, you can
lock and unlock aspect ratio
on the layer.
You can scale any object, with the exception of
locked layers
and layers nested inside a component instance. Learn more about
instance overrides
Scale
To resize an object using the scale tool:
Activate the scale tool by pressing
or by clicking
in the toolbar and selecting
Scale
Select an object.
Scale the object by doing one of the following:
Click and drag
: Hover over the object’s bounding box to make the
cursor appear. Then, click-and-drag to resize.
Scale multiplier
: Use the scale multiplier, in the
Scale
panel of the right sidebar. Open the dropdown to select a multiplier, or type a multiplier in the text field and press
Enter
Return
to apply.
Dimensions fields:
Use either the width or height fields, in the
Scale
panel of the right sidebar. Type a number in either field and press
Enter
Return
to apply. The other dimension field will automatically update.
Set scale direction
The anchor box in the scale panel allows you to set which direction an object scales when using the scale multiplier or dimension fields.
You use the anchor box to set the object’s anchor point, which tells Figma which side of the object to stay put. Once you scale your object, it scales in the opposite direction of the anchor point.
For example, if the anchor point is set to center, the object’s center stays put and resizes in all directions. If you set the anchor point to the top-left, an object will resize down and to the right.
To change an object’s scale direction:
Activate the scale tool
Select the object.
Click on one of the anchor points in the anchor box.
Use the scale multiplier or dimension fields to scale the object.
