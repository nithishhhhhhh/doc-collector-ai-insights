==================================================

Who can use this feature
Anyone on any plan can create styles. Anyone on
Education, Professional, Organization, and Enterprise plans
can publish styles.
Anyone with
can edit
access to a file can create and edit styles. Anyone with at least can view access to a library can use styles from that library.
Styles allows you to define a set of properties that can be reused across your team or organizations's files and projects. Use text styles to define typographic scale within your designs.
You can apply a text style to an entire text layer or a range of text within a layer. For example: you can apply header text to an entire text layer, or style a text string within a paragraph as a link.
Use the table below to see which properties are included in text styles. For more guidance on building typographic systems in Figma, check out our

Apply text styles
Apply text styles to any text layers. If the style lives within your current file, you can reuse it anywhere within that file. To use the style in another file, you'll need to publish the styles as a library.
With the style applied, you can still change any text properties that aren't included in the style. You can also apply color and effect styles to text layers.
Select the text layer.
In the
Typography
section of the right sidebar, click
Select the style from the style picker to apply it to the selected layer:
