UI kits
are a set of libraries curated by Figma and partners (Google and Apple), optionally available from the assets tab in Figma Design files. UI kits contain high-quality components, styles, and example screens kick-start your designs, even if you don’t have a design system of your own.
In order to use
iOS and iPadOS 18 UI kit
, or any UI kits by Apple, you will need to:
✅ Accept Apple’s end user licensing agreement (EULA)
✅ Accept the SF Pro font (optional)
Review and accept the license agreement for Apple Design Resources
The first time you insert a component from Apple’s UI kit, you’ll be prompted to review the license agreement for using Apple Design Resources.
Select
Agree
to continue using Apple’s UI kit.
To download the license agreement document as a PDF, hover over the icon next to the UI kit in the Assets view, and click
License Agreement for Apple Design Resources
Review and accept the license agreement for SF Pro font (optional)
After accepting the Apple Design Resources licensing agreement, you’ll be prompted to review the licensing agreement for SF Pro font. This is not a requirement to use Apple’s UI kit.
Select
Agree
to use the font, and the SF Pro and SF Compact fonts will become available in Figma by default.
If you
Disagree
, you’ll be prompted to replace the font on the canvas with another one. If you change your mind and would like to use SF Pro and SF Compact, apply one of the fonts to a text layer. You’ll be prompted to review the licensing agreement.
If SF Pro or SF Compact is installed on your computer and
available to use in Figma
, then Figma will prioritize your font first.
Tip
: If you want access to SF Mono or SF New York fonts, you can download them to your computer from
Apple’s fonts page
(macOS only).
You will need
Figma's font installer
if you’re using Figma in the browser. If you’re using Figma in the desktop app, the font installer is not needed.
If you’re an organization admin, you can add SF Pro as a shared resource for your entire organization. That way, SF Pro is available from all files of the organization, and individuals won't need to download and install the font on their own. Learn how to
add a font to your organization
