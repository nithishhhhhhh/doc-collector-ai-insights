Team admins can choose which libraries are available in team files. This allows you to quickly share styles, components and variables across team files. This applies to both Figma Design and FigJam files.
Note:
You need to
publish styles, components and variables to your library
before you can enable them as a default library.

Note:
On the
Enterprise plan
, you can set a
default mode
for the team if the library contains a
variable collection
with at least two
modes
For example, you might have a variable collection that contains spacing values for different screen sizes. The variable collection might have three modes: desktop, tablet, and mobile.
If your workspace is dedicated to mobile apps, you could set the default mode to mobile. When someone creates a new file in the workspace, the page level default mode is set to mobile and applies to all variables used on the page. People can always switch to another mode if they need to.
