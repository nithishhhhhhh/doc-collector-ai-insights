The
Selection Colors
feature allows you to view and adjust any colors applied to objects in a selection.
Select objects or layers and view or adjust individual colors in the selection.
Select a parent object, like a Frame, Group, or Component. View and adjust the color properties of any child objects.
Note:
You can still adjust the properties of the parent object in the Properties Panel. This allows you to update Fill and Stroke properties of the Frame, without affecting child objects.
Selection colors include:
âœ… Fills
âœ… Strokes
âœ… Solid colors
âœ… Gradients (linear, radial, angular, diamond)
âœ… Boolean groups*
Selection colors do not include:
ðŸš« Images
ðŸš« Hidden fills

Note:
Only colors applied to the combined Boolean group will be included in the Selection Colors. Colors applied to any child objects won't show up in the Selection Colors section.
