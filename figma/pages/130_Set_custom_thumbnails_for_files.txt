==================================================

Before you start
Who can use this feature
Available on
any team
Anyone with
can edit
access to the file can set a custom thumbnail
Every design file has a thumbnail that shows you a preview of a file's contents. Figma displays this thumbnail wherever the file appears in the file browser.
By default, Figma will base the file thumbnail on the contents of the first page of the file.
You can use the
Set as thumbnail
setting to choose any frame to use as the thumbnail. This is a great way to set expectations and communicate the file's contents.
Note:
Only frames can be used for thumbnails. If you don't see the
Set as thumbnail
option, add your layers to a frame and try again.
Thumbnail dimensions
The exact dimensions of a file thumbnail depends on your display. To make sure your thumbnails aren't awkwardly cropped, we recommend setting the frame’s dimensions to 1920 x 1080 (16:9).
Tip:
Use the
Plugin / file cover
preset from the Figma Community frame templates in the right sidebar.
Set a custom thumbnail for a Figma Design file
Open the design file and find the frame you want to use as the thumbnail.
Figma will scale the selected frame so it fills the thumbnail. We recommend setting the frame’s dimensions to
1920 x 1080
for a proper fit.
Right-click on the frame in the canvas.
Select
Set as thumbnail
from the options.
Figma will update the file's thumbnail and show the
custom thumbnail
icon next to the frame.
Want to remove the frame from the thumbnail?
Right-click on the frame in the canvas and select
Restore default thumbnail
. Figma will use the contents of the first page in your file as the default thumbnail.
Set a custom thumbnail for a FigJam file

custom template
