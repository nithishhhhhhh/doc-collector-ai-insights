Before you start
Who can use this feature
Anyone on
any team or plan
has access to the layers Panel in the Editor.
Only users with
can edit access
can lock and unlock layers.
Lock layers to prevent them from being moved in the canvas, or protect them from accidental edits. When you lock a layer, you can't interact with or move it around in the canvas. You can still select a locked layer in the Layers Panel or adjust any properties of the layer.
If you lock a parent frame or group, then any
child layers
of that frame or group will also be locked. It's not possible to unlock child layers without unlocking the parent.

via the right-click menu. Right-click on the layer, choose
Select layer
, then select the layer from the options. Locked layers have a
padlock next to them.
