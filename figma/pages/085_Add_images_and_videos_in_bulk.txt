==================================================

Who can use this feature
Adding images is supported on
any team or plan
. Adding videos is supported on any
paid team or plan.
Only people with Can
edit access

Place image/video
allows you to import images and/or videos in bulk. You can then choose exactly where you'd like to place each file. As Figma treats images and videos as fills, you can add them to existing objects.
Tip!
Figma supports .png, .jpg, .tiff, or .heic image files, and .mp4, .mov, or .webm video files.
