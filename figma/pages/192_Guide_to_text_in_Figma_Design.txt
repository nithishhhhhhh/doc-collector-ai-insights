Text is a crucial component of interface design. In this article, we’ll cover how to create, edit, and style text in Figma Design. Learn more about using text in

Terminology
There are a few different terms we'll use to talk about text in Figma Design:
Text layers
: Any layers you create with the text tool.
Text contents
: The text content that goes inside of a text layer.
Type properties
: Any text-specific properties in the
Typography
section of the right sidebar. For example: font size, line height, OpenType features, and more.
Other text properties
: Other properties you can apply to text layers, that aren’t related to typography. For example: resizing behavior, fill, stroke, and effects.
Create text layers
Select the
text tool from the toolbar, or using the
keyboard shortcut.
There are two ways you can create a text layer. Click to create an automatically resizing text layer, or click-and-drag to create a text layer with fixed dimensions.
Click to create
Click and drag
Click on the canvas to create a new text layer. This will create a layer with
text resizing
set to
Auto width
. This allows the width of the text box to grow as you add more text. You may know this as point text or paragraph text.
Single click anywhere on the canvas.
Start typing to create a text layer.
Press
Enter
Return
to create a new line.
When the text tool is selected, click and drag on the canvas to create a new text layer.
This creates a layer with
text resizing
set to
Fixed size
. This allows you to enter longer strings of text and have them wrap and overflow on to a new line. This is also known as area text.
Click somewhere on the canvas.
Drag to create a Text layer with specific dimensions.
Type text on a path
You can create text layers that follow the path of a vector object, such as a shape or brush stroke. Use this to create text that flows along curves, circles, or other custom shapes.
To type text on a path:
Select the
Text
tool.
Hover your cursor over the path of a vector object until the text on a path icon appears.
Click to add a new text layer and start typing.
Note:
When you add text to a path, the vector object’s fill and effects are automatically transferred to the text layer. You can modify these properties at any time using the settings in the right sidebar.
As you type, the text layer will wrap around the chosen path. You can use the blue handle to determine where the text layer begins. To switch the text layer to the other side of the path, select
Flip text orientation
In the
Typography
section of the right sidebar.
Edit text content
Double-click on a text layer, or press
Enter
with a text layer selected to edit its contents.
Type directly in the field, or paste in your content. You can
check your spelling in the language of your choice
as you go. You can also add
emoji
icons
lists
, and
hyperlinks
to text.
If you’re writing across languages, you can
switch to bi-directional or right-to-left text
, or
use Noto fonts for text in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
Note
: Once you're editing a text layer, you can update the contents of other text layers without having to double-click. With a text layer selected, click on another text layer to start editing its contents.
Multi-edit text
You can update the content of multiple text layers at the same time.
Select
the text layers you want to update.
Click
Multi-edit text
, or press
Enter
Return
Edit the contents. Any changes you make will apply to all text layers you have selected.
Select fonts
Browse, preview, and select fonts
in the
Typography
section of the right sidebar. There are three ways to use fonts in Figma Design:
Choose from Figma’s selection of free
Google Fonts
Use fonts that are installed on your computer
. Use the Figma desktop app, or
download the Figma font helper
if you are working in the browser.
Figma only supports .TTF and .OTF font files.
If you are on the Organization or Enterprise plan, you can
upload and share fonts
across teams and workspaces.
Caution
: If you are using fonts installed on your computer across teams and files, make sure you are all using the same version of the font. If you can’t edit text, get a missing font alert in some files, or notice text reformatting when editing, editors may be using different versions of the font. Learn how to
troubleshoot font issues
Edit type properties
Adjust any type properties—including font size and weight, spacing, alignment, formatting, and more—in the
Typography
section of the right sidebar.
Explore typography properties
Use OpenType features
Use variable fonts
Define a set of type properties as
text styles
to reuse them across your designs.
Adjust other properties
Adjust other properties of the text layer that aren’t specific to the text’s typography settings.
Layout:
Adjust the text layer's
dimensions and resizing behavior
Color
: Add color, gradients, and images to text using the layer’s
Fill
properties.
Stroke
: Add an outline around individual characters in a text layer using
Stroke
Want to adjust the background color of a text layer?
Applying a fill to a text layer will only update the color of the text. To add a fill behind text, you can add the text layer to a
frame
and update the
Fill
of the frame instead.

You can’t edit a text layer, but you can edit other layers in the file. This means
editors are using different versions of the same font
The text layer moves, reformats, or changes when you try to edit it. This means
editors are using different versions of the same font
Icon fonts show up as a text description when you select or edit the text layer. This means
editors are using different versions of the same font
Adobe fonts are missing in Figma Design
Uninstall the Figma font helper
Note:
Browsers and operating systems can render text differently, which can make designing across systems and platforms unpredictable.
To make sure your designs look consistent, regardless of browser or operating system, Figma uses custom text rendering.
This means there may be subtle differences between your designs in Figma and the final implementation.
