==================================================

Before you start
Who can use this feature
Available on
any plan
Anyone with
can edit
access to a file can create and edit prototypes.
Set how scrolling and panning works in your prototypes to replicate user interactions, such as:
Scroll up and down a long page of content
Scroll left and right to view different elements in a slider
Pan or scroll in any direction, like in an interactive map
Fix objects like navigation bars and menus to one position on the page while scrolling
Create “sticky objects” that stay in place at the top of the frame once you scroll past them
In order to use scrolling in your Figma prototypes, you must:
Prepare frames for scrolling:
Make sure content extends beyond the bounds of the frame’s dimensions.
Apply scroll overflow to frame:
Define if your frame will have vertical, horizontal, both, or no scrolling.
Apply scroll position to the objects within frame:
Define how objects in your frame behave when you scroll past them. They can scroll with the parent frame, stay in a fixed position, or stick to the top of their parent frame.
Once you’ve set up scrolling, you can also consider
preserving or resetting scroll position
when navigating between multiple frames.
Prepare frames for scrolling
In order to add scrolling behavior to a frame, the frame must have content that extends beyond the bounds of the frame.
Think of it like any webpage—when you browse on your phone, you can only see the content that fits the dimensions of your screen. However, there is “hidden” content that exists beyond what you see on your screen that you can only see with scrolling.
Extend content beyond frame dimensions
To resize a frame:
Select the frame you want to update.
Open the
Design
panel in the right sidebar.
Hover over the frame's edge until the cursor appears.
Drag the bounding box to resize the frame.
Constraints define how an object behaves when you resize them. To temporarily ignore
constraints
and auto layout resizing properties, hold down the modifier key as you resize the frame:
Mac
⌘ Command
Windows
Ctrl
To ensure that each object still sits within the selected frame, check the
Layers
section of the left navigation panel. Child objects are nested beneath their parent frame.
Clip content
You can hide any content that extends beyond the bounds of a frame with
Clip content
Select the frame you want to update.
Open the
Design
tab in the right properties panel.
In the
Layout
section, check the box next to
Clip content
Apply scroll overflow to frames
Scroll overflow defines how users can interact with content that extends beyond a frame’s dimensions.
You can only apply overflow behavior to frames. This applies to frames that are directly on the canvas (top-level frames), as well as frames nested within other frames or layers.
To apply scroll overflow to a frame:
Select a frame.
Open the
Prototype
tab in the right properties panel.
In the
Scroll behavior
section, select the
Overflow
dropdown. Choose from:
No scrolling
Horizontal
Vertical
Both directions
Note:
If you receive an error message marked by an exclamation point (”For scrolling to work on this frame, the content needs to be bigger than the frame”), this means you still need to
prepare the frame for scrolling
by extending the content of the frame beyond the frame’s dimensions.
Vertical
Vertical scrolling allows users to swipe or scroll up and down. Use this behavior to mimic scrolling down a long website, or page of content within an app.
Horizontal
Horizontal scrolling allows users to swipe or scroll left and right, while maintaining their vertical position. Use this to create sliders for content, like products, galleries, and libraries.
No scrolling
No scrolling prevents users from scrolling in any direction. Content that extends beyond the bounds of the frame will not be viewable.
Both directions
Both directions (horizontal and vertical) lets users navigate in any direction, like when viewing a map or enlarged image.
Apply scroll position to objects within a frame
Scroll position defines how layers in a frame behave when users scroll past them. You can only apply one scroll position to each layer.
Select an object, group, or component. The object must be on a frame that has scroll overflow applied.
Open the
Prototype
tab in the right properties panel.
In the
Scroll behavior
section, select the
Position
dropdown. Choose from:
Scroll with parent
Fixed
Sticky
Scroll with parent
Objects that scroll with parent move up and down the frame as you scroll. Use this behavior to mimic the behavior of scrolling up and down longer pages of content.
Fixed
Fixed objects don’t move, even as you scroll up and down. For example, use this option to fix a status bar to the top of the device, or fix a menu to the bottom of a frame.
You cannot assign a fixed scroll position to any objects in a frame with auto layout, unless the object has
absolute position
applied.
When you set an object to fixed, Figma will move it above the other layers in the frame and label them as
Fixed
in the
Layers
section of the left navigation panel. It's not possible to position scrolling objects above fixed layers.
Sticky
Apply sticky scroll position to any object within a frame that has vertical scrolling.
Sticky objects will scroll at first, but become fixed once its top edge reaches the top of its parent frame. (If you scroll up again, the object will unstick and move down the parent frame.)
Tip:
We use the terms
parent
child
sibling
, and
top-level frame
to describe relationships between objects in Figma. Learn more about
layer hierarchy in Figma →
If the sticky object is nested within another layer in a frame, it stays within its direct parent’s bounds. This means that when the direct parent layer is scrolled out of view, the sticky object continues scrolling with its parent.
Check the
Layers
section in the left navigation panel to see how sticky objects will stack when scrolling. Any layers below a sticky object will scroll behind it, and any layers above a sticky object will scroll in front of it. To change the order in which your objects stack for sticky scroll, change their order in the
Layers
panel.
Note:
In an auto layout frame, rearranging layers in the
Layers
section of the left navigation panel will affect the order in which layers visually appear on the canvas.
By default, objects in an auto layout frame have their canvas stacking setting set to
Last on top
, which means layers visually at the bottom of a frame stack in front of layers above them.
To reverse the order so that layers stack from top-to-bottom:
Select the auto layout frame.
From the
Auto layout
section of the right sidebar, select
Auto layout
settings
From the
Canvas stacking
dropdown menu, select
First on top

auto layout →
Preserve and reset scroll position
When your prototype contains multiple pages or screens, you can choose to preserve scroll position or reset scroll position between frames.
Preserve scroll position:
Maintain the user’s scroll position when they transition between frames
Reset scroll position:
Reset the user’s scroll position when they transition between frames

how to preserve or reset scroll position in prototypes →
Note:
Preserving scroll position is a type of prototype state management. State management allows us to maintain object properties and states when navigating in and across frames when playing prototypes—and can apply to scroll position, interactive components, and videos.
