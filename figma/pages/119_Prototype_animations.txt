Animations can be used to create smooth transitions between pages and define the behavior for actions like expanding a menu, swiping between pages, or opening a gallery.
Instant
The Instant transition will immediately display the
Destination
Frame, when the hotspot is interacted with (clicked, hovered over, or pressed).
Dissolve
The Dissolve transition will fade in the
Destination
frame, on top of the original frame.
Supports:

Easing
Smart Animate
Smart Animate looks for matching layers that exist across multiple frames. For layers that match, we recognize what's changed and apply transitions to seamlessly move between them.
Supports:

Easing
Move In / Move Out
The Move transition will slide the
Destination
frame
into
out of
view, above the original frame.
Supports:
Easing

Push
The Push transition will push out the original frame, as the
Destination
frame is moved into view. This is the perfect transition for replicating a swiping gesture.

Slide In / Slide Out
The Slide will move the
Destination
frame
into
out of
view. Slide will slowly offset the frame as it dissolves, while the Move transition keeps the original frame stationary.

Use
prototype easing and spring animation curves
to give your animations a unique and natural feel.
