access to a published file can use styles from that library in files where they can edit.
Styles allow you to define a set of properties of an object, that can be reused across your designs.
Create styles for:
Text
: font family, size, line height, spacing
Text styles can be applied to an entire layer or portions of text. This is perfect for defining the styles of headers, body text, and text within paragraphs—such as linked text.
Because text styles can’t be created for text alignment, you must set alignment for each block individually.
Colors
: fill, stroke, image, gradient
When creating a style for a gradient, both the colors used and the gradient direction, or angle, will be saved to the style.
Effects
: drop shadow, inner shadow, layer blur, background blur
A style can include more than one effect and all applied properties will be saved to the style.
Shadow styles are represented as icons in the
Effects
section of the right sidebar and vary according to their direction. These icons can also vary between drop or inner shadows and their x, y values.
Layout guides for frames
: row, column, uniform grid
This is useful for replicating a specific format or structure across multiple designs.
Guide styles are represented as icons in the
Layout guides
section of the right sidebar and vary according to type:
Uniform g
rid, Columns,
Rows

Tip!
You can give Styles both a name and a description. We recommend using the name and description to communicate how Styles should be used in your designs, versus simply using a description of the color.
To make finding and selecting styles easier, you can also organize your styles into folders. Learn more about
naming, managing, and sharing styles
