Transforms allow you to create dynamic, repeating patterns from objects in your design file. You can access transforms while in
Figma Draw
Similar to using
boolean operations
, transforms are non-destructive actions, meaning they don’t permanently alter your original object. When you add a transform to an object, the object is added to a transform group. This preserves that original object, allowing you to select and modify it at any time. You can also add additional objects to the transform group to increase the complexity of your design.
There are two types of transforms:
Radial repeat:
Repeats the object around a central point, creating circular arrangements
Linear repeat:
Repeats the object in a horizontal or vertical line, creating evenly spaced sequences

Add a transform to an object
To add a transform to an object:
In Figma Design, use the toolbar toggle to switch to
Draw
Select the object you want to transform.
In the right sidebar, select an option from the
Additional transform modifier
menu.
After adding a transform, you can click on it in the right sidebar to access the
Transform
settings. From here, you can adjust the number of repetitions and how the repetitions are spaced.
Using transforms doesn’t automatically add additional layers to the canvas. To convert your transform into layers, select
Apply transforms to selection
when you’re happy with your arrangement.
