==================================================

Before you start
Who can use this feature
Supported on
any team or plan
Anyone
can leave a library file.
When you disable the library, Figma will remove those components from the
Assets
panel and any styles from the style picker. As you still have access to the library, styles, components, and variables may still show up in your search results.
If you don't want those assets to show up in search results, you'll need to
leave the library file
where the main assets live.
