==================================================

Before you Start
Who can use this feature
Available on
all plans
Available in Figma Design and Figma Sites. You can also access auto layout from design mode in Figma Slides and Figma Buzz.
Anyone with
can edit
access to a file can use auto layout
Auto layout can be used on frames so that designs will respond dynamically to content changes, saving you time and making your designs responsive and adaptable.
Elements in an auto layout frame are automatically arranged in a frame based on direction, spacing, padding, alignment, and other auto layout properties. When the content changes or elements are added, removed, or resized, the layout adjusts without requiring manual repositioning.
Use auto layout to create responsive designs, such as:
Buttons that grow or shrink as you edit the text label
Lists that adapt as items are added, removed, or hidden
Bento boxes and dashboards
A webpage that fits different screen sizes
Add auto layout
To start using auto layout on designs, select one or more layers and press
‚áß Shift
or click
Add auto layout
from the right sidebar. Figma will try to determine which
auto layout flow
‚Äîvertical, horizontal, or grid‚Äîyou want to use. You can switch to a different flow at anytime.
Learn more about toggling auto layout on designs.
Choose an auto layout flow
Once auto layout is being used on a frame, you can choose from three options to determine the flow and arrangement of objects in the frame:
Vertical
Horizontal
Grid
Horizontal and vertical
The
Vertical
option places objects in your frame along the y-axis. Any objects you add, remove, or reorder will follow the y-axis. For example: Multiple list items in a to-do list, or posts within a newsfeed or timeline.
The
Horizontal
option places objects in your frame along the x-axis. Any objects you add, remove, or reorder will follow the x-axis. For example: A row of buttons, or icons in a mobile navigation menu.
When you have the horizontal selected,
Wrap
becomes available. Wrap pushes any overflowing objects to the next line in your frame.
The horizontal and vertical auto layout options also have additional properties like resizing, spacing, alignment, and more.
Learn more about the horizontal and vertical auto layout flows.
Grid
open beta
üöß The grid option for auto layout is currently in
open beta
. Some functions and settings may not yet be available to grid. The feature may change and you may experience bugs or performance issues during the beta period.
The
Grid
option places objects in columns and rows, allowing you to create galleries, bento boxes, and dashboard layouts that respond and resize to different frame sizes.
Unlike the wrap setting for horizontal and vertical flows, objects in a grid don‚Äôt wrap to the next line. Instead, they are placed in a ‚Äúgrid‚Äù and have the option to span multiple rows or columns.
Grid auto layout frames will also have additional properties like column and row resizing, span, and more.
Learn about how to use the grid auto layout flow.
Adjust spacing properties
The types of properties available on your auto layout frame will depend on which auto layout flow is being used. However, all flows share a couple of key spacing properties:
Padding
is the empty or white space between the edge of a parent auto layout frame and its objects. You can set padding uniformly, vertically and horizontally, or have different values for top, right, bottom, and left padding.
Gap between
is the distance or distribution between objects in an auto layout frame. Use number value specify exactly how far apart you want objects to be. Or, for vertical and horizontal auto layout frames, you also have the option to set the gap between items to
Auto
so that objects have the largest distance from each other as possible.
Tip
: To learn more about properties specific to each auto layout flow, check out their respective help articles:

Adjust responsiveness with resizing
Note
: While grid is in beta, the
grid option
may be limited in in resizing properties and functionality.
One of the most powerful functions of auto layout is its ability to make objects adapt their dimensions to the settings and objects around them using the resizing property. You can set resizing behavior on a parent auto layout frame to determine how it resizes based on changes made to its contents, and vice versa.
Resizing settings can be applied on both the X and Y axes using the
width
and
height
dropdown menus in the right panel.
When you hover over a resizing option from the dropdown, lines appear on the canvas to indicate how the bounding box of the design will resize and change.
Resizing property
Can be applied to‚Ä¶
Dimensions behavior
Hug contents
Auto layout frames
Object resizes based on its child objects
Fill container
Child objects of auto layout frames
Object fills all available space
Fixed width / height
Both
Object stays fixed
Minimum width / height
Both
Object is equal to or greater than the minimum
Maximum width / height
Both
Object is equal to or lesser than the maximum
Hug contents
Use
hug contents
on any auto layout frame, so it keeps the smallest possible dimensions around its child objects while respecting any spacing values.
For example, let‚Äôs say you have a text layer that is 40px wide inside of a frame that uses auto layout. The frame‚Äôs padding is set to 10px on the left and right sides. Since its resizing is set to hug contents, the frame‚Äôs width is 60px. If the text layer gets updated and is now 50px wide, then the frame‚Äôs width will change to 70px.
Hug contents can be applied only to auto layout frames.
Tip
:¬†Double-click the vertical or horizontal edge of an auto layout object's bounding box to set it to
Hug contents
Note:
If any child objects within an auto layout frame are set to
Fill container
, the parent frame will no longer hug contents and become
Fixed
for the axis.
Fill container
Layers set to
Fill container
stretches to occupy all available space in their parent frame, while respecting any spacing values.
Fill container can be applied only to child objects of auto layout frames, and is not available for top-level frames.
Child objects of an auto layout frame will also be set to
Fill container
if they are manually resized to the full available space of the parent frame.
Tip
: Hold
‚å• Option
Alt
and double-click the vertical or horizontal edge of an auto layout object's bounding box to set it to
Fill container
Fixed width or height
Set a
Fixed
width or height on a layer to make sure its dimensions stay fixed and unchanged, regardless of changes to surrounding spacing values and to child, parent, or sibling objects.
Fixed can be applied to any auto layout frame and its children.
If you manually resize a layer, or specify a value to its width or height field, then the resizing property will be set to fixed on the respective axis.
For example, let‚Äôs say you have a button component that uses auto layout, and its width is set to hug contents. If you enter a value like
125
into the width field, the resizing property will change to
Fixed width
Minimum and maximum dimensions
Note
: Minimum and maximum dimensions is an additional setting that can be used at the same time as other resizing properties.
Set minimum or maximum width and height to any auto layout frame and its children.
Open the
Width
dropdown to find
Add min width
and
Add max width
Open the
Height
dropdown to find
Add min height
and
Add max height
Select an option from the Width or Height dropdown menu. From the new field that appears, enter a value or use the dropdown to apply a number variable.
If an object contains a min or max setting, its respective width or height icon will gain two lines, one on each side. You can hover over these icons to preview the dimension limits on canvas.
When you deselect and reselect an object, its min and max dimension fields will be hidden from the right panel. To access them again, click on the width or height icon.
To remove a min or max setting, open the
Width
Height
dropdown and choose
Remove min and max
Ignore auto layout
Note:
Ignore auto layout was formerly known as absolute position. The feature has a new name, but it still works the same.
An object with
Ignore auto layout
enabled is excluded from¬†an auto layout flow while keeping it in the auto layout frame. The object and its surrounding siblings ignore each other, even as they resize and move.
Much like absolute position in CSS, an object that ignores auto layout can be placed precisely where you want relative to its parent container.
Objects with ignore auto layout enabled are treated as objects in a regular frame. This means you can apply
constraints
to determine how they respond when its parent auto layout frame resizes. Other auto layout settings, such as resizing and layout options, aren‚Äôt available to these objects.
You can have an object ignore the auto layout flow by doing one of the following:
Select a child of an auto layout frame, and click¬†in the right panel
Drag an object into an auto layout frame while pressing¬†¬†‚åÉ Control.
Nest auto layout frames
The true power of auto layout's responsiveness emerges when combining resizing behaviors across nested auto layout frame.
Nesting refers to the act of placing a layer inside of another layer, such as placing a button inside a component, or a shape inside of a frame.
Nesting an auto layout frame within another auto layout frame allows you to combine horizontal, vertical, and grid auto layout options to create complex interfaces. The nested frames will have both parent and child properties, each frame with its own separate padding and gap-between values, allowing us for multi-dimensional layouts with elements that flow in different directions and arrangements.
Learn how to create multi-dimensional auto layout flows.
Considerations with other features
Constraints
You can't apply constraints to child objects in an auto layout frame, unless the object
ignores the auto layout flow
. Instead, you can use the resizing property to define how objects respond as the frame, or the objects in the frame, resize.
You can still apply constraints to the auto layout frame itself if it's nested within a regular frame. The
Constraints
section and resizing options will appear, allowing you to set both the constraints for the Auto layout frame and the resizing behavior for any objects within it.
For example: Let's say we a habit logging app where each habit gets an analytics screen containing a calendar history of habit completions and a panel at the bottom for notes on any given day. This screen uses auto layout, but the notes panel ignores the auto layout flow. We can use set constraints
Bottom
and
Left and right
to make sure the notes panel responds correctly when its parent frame is resized.
Learn more about constraints.
Components and instances
As components are frames, you can add auto layout to them. You will need to add auto layout to each component individually. There isn't currently a way to add auto layout in bulk.
Action
Main component
Instance
Adjust vertical and horizontal padding
Adjust gap between
Reorder layers
Add new layers
Delete or remove layers
(Hides layer only)
Want to add icons to instances?
We recommend adding a placeholder icon, with 0% opacity, to the main component. You can then swap out the icon for another component in your library.
Prototypes with auto layout
There are a few things to be mindful of when creating prototypes with auto layout.
Smart animate transitions do not take into account the background of a frame. If you want to use a
Slide in
Move in
transition with smart animate, you will need to add a background. You can create a rectangle within a regular frame and place your auto layout frame within it. Learn more about
slide in and move in transitions
To apply scrolling overflow to a frame, you need to have content to extend beyond the frame's bounds.
As an auto layout parent's dimensions are content-driven, it will resize to fit the objects. To replicate scrolling overflow you will need to put the auto layout inside a regular frame.
Note:
Presentation view supports scrolling of long frames by default. You will only need to use this workaround when you want to clip content.
Text layers, max height, and max lines
Text layers cannot have both a
max height
and a set number of
max lines
. Adding a max height will set max lines to Auto. Setting max lines to a number will remove the layer‚Äôs max height setting.
Learn more about max lines
Text resizing
Text layers also have their own resizing properties. Within an auto layout frame, this may produce some useful results.
If you want your auto layout frames to be completely fluid, we advise against using fixed size text boxes. Fixed size text layers won't resize to accommodate your text, which may cause overlap between layers in an auto layout frame.
