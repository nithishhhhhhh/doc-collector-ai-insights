Available on

Learn how to
get started with prototyping
Add links to any text layer within your design file to:
Direct collaborators to external sites like documentation and project management tools
Create navigation within a large Figma file to specific frames and pages
Link to other Figma files and prototypes
Represent actual links that will exist in production
Note:
It's not currently possible to add links to images or vector objects in the Editor, only when
creating prototype hotspots
. Linking to default email clients using HTML like
mailto:
is not supported at this time.

Interact with links
Preview or follow a link
To preview a URL link, hover over the linked text.
To follow a link, click the linked text. What happens when you follow the linked text depends on the type of link:
Figma Design or FigJam files:
Links to other Figma files, prototypes, frames, or pages open in a new tab.
Page or frame in current file:
Figma takes you to the page or frame in the current file.
External website:
All external links open in a new tab in your browser. If it’s your first time opening a link, you'll need to confirm that you're leaving Figma.
To prevent a link from opening when clicking it, hold
⌘ Command
Control
while clicking.
Note:
If you’re in text edit mode, you’ll need to hover over the linked text and click the URL from the link modal.
Edit or delete a link

Click or hover over the linked text to open the link modal.

If you double-click a linked text and the
Edit
button is unavailable, this means the layer is locked.
