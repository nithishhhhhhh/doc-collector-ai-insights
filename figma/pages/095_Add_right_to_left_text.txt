==================================================

Before you start
Who can use this feature
Supported on
any plan
Available in Figma Design and FigJam files
Users with
can edit
access to a file can use RTL and bidirectional text controls
RTL languages and bidirectional text are supported in Figma Design and FigJam files. Control the direction of bidirectional text on text layers, stickies, arrows, and more.
RTL
(right-to-left) refers to scripts, or writing systems, that start on the right and continue to the left. This includes Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, Urdu, and more.
Bidirectional
(bidi) text refers to text containing both RTL and LTR (left-to-right) scripts, or writing systems.
By default, Figma automatically handles text direction based on language detection. However, you can override
text direction with controls ↓
in Figma Design and FigJam files.
RTL fonts are available by default in Figma Design. If a character isn’t supported by the font you’re using, Figma will
fall back ↓
to a Noto font.
Note:
If any RTL plugins were previously used on text layers in files, the text will be preserved. However, you can
upgrade these text ↓
layers to use Figma’s RTL and bidi features.
RTL text
Align text
In Figma Design files, text layers default to
left alignment
. That is, the blocks of text align to the left side of the layer’s bounding box. However, Figma will remember the alignment setting of the previous edited text layer until the file tab refreshes or closes.
Note:
Each text layer can have one text alignment. If you need different text alignment, create a new text layer.
FigJam
, text will automatically right-align on new stickies if you’re typing in an RTL script.
Navigate text
Mixing RTL and LTR scripts in the same text layer affects how highlighting and cursor movements work.
When using the left and right arrow keys to navigate through your text, think of their directions as “forward” and “backward” based on the
direction setting ↓
of the text.
When clicking and holding your mouse to highlight bits of text, the highlight moves in the direction of the selected language.
Direction controls
Figma supports bidirectional text, so you can write in both LTR and RTL scripts in the same paragraph. By default, Figma automatically handles text direction based on language detection. However, controls are available to override text direction per paragraph in Figma Design and FigJam files.
If an RTL script is detected in your text layer, a
will appear in the text section of the right sidebar, allowing you to control the text direction.

Supported fonts
If you are using the
Figma desktop app
, you can use any fonts already on your computer. If you're using Figma in the browser, you can
install the Figma Font Helper
to access your installed fonts.
Figma’s default font list includes RTL fonts.
If the font you’re using does not support the RTL scripts you’re typing, Figma will
fall back to a different font ↓
Tip!
Figma supports most Google fonts. Go to
fonts.google.com
and use the
Languages
filter to find fonts that support the script you want to use.
Font fallback
Font fallback allows you to use characters and icons that aren't specifically supported by that font.
If a font doesn't support a character you input, Figma will render that specific character in a Noto font. No more empty spaces or missing character icons.
Text using RTL plugins
Any RTL plugins previously used on text layers in Figma Design or text in FigJam will be preserved. However, you can upgrade the text to use Figma’s RTL and bidirectional control features.
Before you upgrade:
Check the RTL plugin for a way to reset the text to its original state before the plugin was used. This ensures your text will flow as expected when you upgrade to using Figma’s RTL and bidirectional features.
If the plugin doesn’t provide a way to reset the text, you can still upgrade it to use Figma’s RTL and bidi features, but you will need to create a new text layer and rewrite your copy.
