Before you Start
Who can use this feature
Available on all paid plans
Anyone with a
Full seat
and
can edit
access to a file can add measurements and annotations
Anyone with a
Full
or a
Dev seat
and at least
can view
access to a file can view measurements and annotations
Use annotations and measurements to create speedier and more transparent handoffs that stay up-to-day, even as designs change.
With annotations, designers can communicate and connect key details directly to designs:
Highlight important properties so developers can't miss them
Help developers quickly visualize specs like spacing and sizing
Share additional context with text notes
Create and categorize annotations for easier navigation
Developers can see annotations update in real time as they work in Dev Mode, ensuring they don’t miss any crucial callouts during handoff.
Add measurements to a design
Adding measurements
to quickly
visualize spacing and sizing between components.
To add a measurement to a design:
Click
Measurement
in the toolbar or use the keyboard shortcut
Shift
Hover over a layer to see options for where to start your measurement.
Click and drag from your starting point to the layer where you want the measurement to end.
Click and drag the measurement so it doesn’t cover the design.
You can double-click on the measurement to customize its text.
Tip:
To delete a measurement, click it and press the
Delete
Backspace
key.
Add annotations to a design
Designers can add annotations to provide context, define design properties, or communicate other relevant information for developers to turn design into code. You can annotate a layer’s
defined properties, like alignment direction or sizing, or provide additional details with free text.
Even if designs are later updated, annotation properties stay-up-to-date and accurate, ensuring nothing gets lost in translation.
You can add annotations from Design or Dev Mode. To add annotations to a design:
Click
Annotation
in the toolbar or use the keyboard shortcut
Shift
Select the layer you’d like to annotate.
Write a note in the text field, or click
+ Property
to select a property from the list. You can include both plain text and properties in an annotation.
Categorize annotations
Give annotations even more clarity by categorizing them. Categories help distinguish different types of annotations, making it easier to scan for relevant information.
Editors can use the default labels, as well as edit or delete those categories. Category labels only apply to the current file
nothing will change in other files when you edit or delete the default categories.
Figma design files come with preset annotation categories:
Development
Interaction
Accessibility
Content
To add a new category:
Select an existing annotation or create a new one, then click the category dropdown.
Click
Edit categories…
Click
, then select a color and type in a name for your new category label.
Note:
Copying layers that have annotations with categories will copy over the category from the source file to the target file. If there is no exact match in the target file (color and label), a new category is defined.
Tip:
With the plugin API, teams can build custom Dev Mode plugins to create and manage annotations in bulk.
Check out the Figma Plugin API reference to learn how you can automate and customize annotations with plugins.
Filter by category
You can filter annotations by category, making it even easier to find the details you need on the canvas. There are a couple of ways to filter annotations by category:
Right-click menu
Right-click an annotation on the canvas.
Select
Filter by
Select which category you want to filter by, or select
All categories
Zoom menu in Dev Mode
Click the zoom dropdown in the Dev Mode right sidebar.
Hover over
Annotations
