New to libraries in Figma Design? Check out the
Guide to
librari
When someone publishes an update to a main component, style, or variable in a library, Figma makes the updates available in every file where the component, style, or variable is used.
View available updates
You can view all updates at once, or view updates to a single component, style, or variable.
View all updates
When library updates are available, the
Libraries
icon on the
Assets
tab in the left sidebar will display a blue badge.
Note
: The
Libraries
icon will also display a blue badge if you have made updates to a library resource that need to be published. Learn more about
publishing updates to libraries
To view all available updates:
Click
Review library updates
on the
Assets
tab in the left sidebar.
Select the
Updates
tab. By default, the
Updates
tab displays assets on the current page. Use the
Show updates for all pages
toggle to see all available updates.
Click
Update
next to an individual asset, or
Update all
to apply all updates. Updates are applied to assets on every page of the file.
View updates for a single component or style
When you select an instance or a layer using a style or variable with an available update, an
update icon will appear in the
Design
tab of the right sidebar. Click
Update available
and then select
Update selected instance
Review update
Review updates
You can review updates before applying them to instances in your file.
Click on an update from the
Updates
tab of the library panel or click
Review update
with an instance selected to review the changes.
By default, Figma shows a
Side by side
view of the change. Use the toggle to switch to an
Overlay
view, which places the updated component, style, or variable on top of the current instance. The
Overlay
view has a slide to change the opacity of the updated component, style, or variable to visually compare the difference with the original.
If there are multiple instances of the updated component, style, or variable in the file, you can use the arrows to review each instance on the canvas. Click
Update instance
to update each instance individually, or click
Update all
to change them all at once.
Note
: You won’t be able to visually compare updates made to hidden layers in a component.
