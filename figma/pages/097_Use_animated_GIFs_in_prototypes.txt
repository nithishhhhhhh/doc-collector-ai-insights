==================================================

Who can use this feature
Supported on
all paid plans
Anyone with
can edit
access can add GIFs to Figma Design files
Add GIFs to your design files and view them in
presentation view
. This allows you to simulate videos or animations, and create more dynamic prototypes.
Due to browser limitations, the width or height of an image
must not be larger than 4096 pixels
. Figma will scale any larger images so they fit within these limitations.
Add animated GIFs
Like
regular static images
, you can apply animated GIFs to layers as fills. This means you to apply them to any vector shape, including text layers. There are a few ways to add GIFs to your designs:
Drag and drop GIFs onto the canvas
Import files via the file browser
Add images to objects in bulk with place image
Upload image as fills
Copy and paste image fills between layers
Want to copy and paste an animated GIF from a website in the browser?
Some browsers will only allow you to copy a static version of the GIF. We recommend saving a copy of the GIF to your computer, then dragging the file into Figma.
View animated GIFs
Animated GIFs only play in
presentation view
. When viewing the file in the editor, animated GIFs appear as static images.
Identify GIFs by their GIF label in:
Fill
section in the right sidebar
Fill
modal
Layers panel
Next to the image's dimensions in the canvas
Manipulate or edit GIFs
Like static images, you can also manipulate aspects of a GIF. You can:
Scale, rotate and adjust the dimensions of GIFs
Adjust the opacity, fill mode, and rotation of a GIF
Apply or combine with blend modes
Create styles and components with GIFs
Apply masks to only show a part of the GIF
Apply scrolling overflow settings to GIFs
Create overlays in prototypes using GIFs
There are also a few extra options for GIFs:
View images and animated GIFs in the
Figma mobile app
Keep and export metadata including Frame delay and # of Loops
Choose which frame of the GIF you want to display in the canvas
There are some actions you can't take with animated GIFs. You can't:
Apply
image adjustments
to GIFs. We recommend layering fills and using
blend modes
instead.
View animated GIFs in the canvas (editor). Animated GIFs only play back in
presentation view
Export animated GIFs from Figma. Figma can only export animated GIFs as static images.
