Measure distances between objects in the canvas with measurement guides. This allows you to measure the distance between:
Vector shapes and paths
Text layers
Frames
Components
Groups
Guides
Note:
It's not currently possible to measure the distance between two guides. To calculate the distance between two guides, select the first guide and hover over the second guide. Figma will display the position of both guides on the axis so you can calculate the difference.
Measure distances
Measure distances between objects, even if they are nested within Frames, groups, or Components.
Select the first object in the canvas.
Hold down the modifier key:
Mac:
⌥ Option
Windows:
Alt
Hover over the second object.
Figma will display a red line between the two objects, as well as horizontal and vertical measurements.
Measure distances between nested layers
Select the first object in the canvas.
Hold down the modifier keys:
Mac:
⌘ Command
⌥ Option
Windows:
Control
Alt
Hover over the second object.
Figma will display a red line between the two objects, as well as a measurement.
Note:
It's not currently possible to change the weight or color of the red measurement line. If you are working with similar or low-contrast colors, and want to see the measurement line, you can toggle the Fill visibility of the low contrast layer.
Object bounds
Figma will measure the distances between the
bounds
of each object - the bounding box that surrounds an object or layer.
There are some situations of types of objects where this behavior may not be what you expect.
Strokes:
If you have strokes applied to an object, Figma will measure to the object's bounds and not the outer limit of the stroke. You will notice this more on objects with
Center
Outside
stroke.
Text layers:
Figma will measure the distance from the text layer's bounds. If you're wanting to measure to the baseline of the text, we recommend updating the bounds of the layer to match the baseline. You may also need to adjust the
text resizing property
Polygons and stars:
If you have shapes with an odd number of sides, an object's bounding box may extend beyond the shape's dimensions.
To snap the
bounding box
to the shape's true boundary, you can
flatten
the shape.
Right-click
Flatten
Overlapping layers
Overlapping layers may prevent you from being able to measure the distance between nested objects. This includes masks, locked layers, and layers with low-opacity fills.
If you're having trouble measuring to a nested layer, we recommend you check the layers panel for any of the above layers.
If there is a layer blocking your measurement, you can:
Toggle the layer's visibility
to temporarily hide it. Use the keyboard shortcut:
Mac
⌘ Command
Shift
Windows
Control
Shift
Toggle the Fill visibility
Reorder the layer
so that it's below the layer you want to measure to
Hold down the modifier key to measure to a nested layer
Mac

Want to add more permanent measurements to a file? Check out the
Figma Measure plugin
Vector edit mode
Measure between anchor points when you are in vector edit mode. Use this to measure distances between existing anchor points, or to create a new point.
Select the object you want to edit.
Click
Edit object
in the toolbar, or press the
Enter
Return
key.
Click on an anchor point to select that point.
Hold down the modifier key
Mac:
⌥ Option
Windows:
Alt
Hover over an existing to measure the horizontal and vertical distance between those two points.
You can also use the measuring tool to see the distance between the selected point and a new anchor point. Click on the canvas to add a new point in that position.
Press
Enter
Return
to leave vector edit mode.
