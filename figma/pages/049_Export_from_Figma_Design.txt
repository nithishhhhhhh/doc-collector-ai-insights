Select part of your design to export using the Slice tool
If you have
can edit
access to a file, you can use the
Slice
tool to select and export a portion of your canvas. This is useful for sharing parts of your design workflow or creating high-quality screenshots.
The
Slice
tool is located under the Region tools dropdown in the toolbar. To create a slice, click and drag the
Slice
tool around the region you want to export. You can move and resize the slice as needed. Keep in mind that only content within the slice’s boundaries will be exported. Once the slice is positioned where you want it, you can apply export configurations to it like any other object.
Tip:
Slices also let you control padding around the exported object. Otherwise the padding is computed from the overall shape bounds. The latter adjusts when the shape changes size, whereas the slice is absolute.
Locate the export settings
After you’ve selected the content you want to export, you can create export configurations using the settings in the
Export
section. The location of the
Export
section differs depending on your level of access to the file and the mode you’re using.
Note:
If you don’t see the
Export
section, try refreshing the page. If that doesn’t work, the file owner may have restricted viewers from being able to copy or export assets from the file. Learn more about
restricting copying and sharing on files →
