==================================================

As a developer, when you’re reviewing designs in Dev Mode, you’ll encounter color, number, string, and boolean variables. The values of those variables can be dependent on things like the variable mode, which sometimes makes it harder to identify the exact values you want to pull from the design.
Figma provides a few options in Dev Mode to make working with variables easier for developers:
Variable details
Suggested variables
Access local variable collections
Variable details
When you're inspecting a design in Dev Mode, you can view details about variables used in the design. The
Variable details
modal lists information about a variable including:
The name of the variable
A link to the file that hosts the variable
The name of the variable collection that contains the variable
The variable’s mode
The variable’s value and, if relevant, the chain of aliases to a raw value
The scope of the variable (where it can be used)
A code snippet for using the variable
A useful feature is the ability to follow the a chain of
variable aliases
back to a specific value. For example, in the previous image, the
Background/Positive/Default
variable uses
Green/500
as an alias, which corresponds to the color value
#14AE5C
Using the
Variable details
modal, you can also change modes, letting you see the other values the variable can have.
Open the Variable details modal
There are two ways to open the
Variable details
modal:
For variables that appear in a code snippet, such as design tokens in CSS, click on the variable name in the in the
Inspect
panel to open the
Variable details
modal.
For other variables, such as those that appear in the
Selection colors
section, click
Variable details
in the
Inspect
panel to open the
Variable details
modal.
Suggested variables
In Dev Mode, when you’re inspecting a design, you’ll sometimes encounter raw values rather than variables or styles. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as if a designer happened to detach a variable during the design phase. When you encounter a raw value, you may want to see if there’s an existing variable that should be used instead.
To help make identifying corresponding variables easier, Dev Mode can suggest variables.
To suggest a variable, the variable must have:
Exactly the same value
The appropriate scope
You can click a suggested variable to copy the name.
Get suggested variables
To get suggested variables for a value in Dev Mode, in the
Inspect
panel, click the value you want to get a suggestion for. The
Suggested variables
modal appears next to the value you clicked.
Access local variable collections
In Dev Mode, you can access and view the local variable collections in the file.
For example, in the previous image, in the
Collections from this file
section, the
Color Primitives
variable collection is selected. These names are just examples — the actual collection and variable names correspond to the local variables and collections in your file.
Below the
Collections from this file
section is a list of all the variable groups that appear in the collection, such as
Brand
Black
, and
White
. By default,
All variables
is selected. The groups are ordered the same way they’re organized in the
Variables modal
For the group that’s selected, the variables table displays the variables, along with the values for each mode a variable has. If you have
All variables
selected, the table is organized by group.
You can click on individual variables and values to copy them to your clipboard and to view details about the variable.
Open the variables table
When you have no layers selected in Dev Mode, you can open a table of all variables that were created in your file. To open the variables table, in the
Variables
section of the inspect panel, click
Open variables table
. The variables table expands to fill the canvas.
