==================================================

Before you Start
Who can use this feature
Available on
any plan
Anyone with at least
can view
access to the file can save the file as a local copy as long as the file’s owner has not
restricted copying and sharing
You can save a local copy of a file in the
.fig
(Figma Design),
.jam
(FigJam), or .deck (Figma Slides) formats. This is useful if you want to duplicate files between Figma accounts or teams, or if you want to manually back up your files.
Figma doesn't include any version history or comments when you save a local copy of a file. When you reimport this file, Figma treats this like a new file and it won't be connected to the original. Any components in the imported file
will
become new main components. Instances in the imported file will connect to the new main components and will not receive updates from components in the original file.
Note:
The .fig, .jam, and .deck file formats are proprietary and may change in the future. We recommend against using any third-party tools that ask for these file types because they may not be able to properly read these files. If you're building a third-party tool, we recommend accessing files and their contents through one of
Figma’s officially supported APIs
