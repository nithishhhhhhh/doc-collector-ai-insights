==================================================

Who can use this feature
Users on
any
plan
can create Components. Users on a Starter team can't publish Components to a Library.
Users with can
edit
access to a file can create and edit components.
Users with
can view
access to a file can use components from a
library
, if they have access to it.
You can create a component out of any collection of objects or layers. Components can be as simple as shapes, buttons or fields, or more complex design like cards and menus.
Tip!
As you create components and build out your design system, you'll find the need for components that are similar to each other, with only slight differences.
Variants allow you to group and organize similar components into a single container. This simplifies your component library and makes it easier for everyone to find what they need.

Create a component
You can create a single component out of selection of layers. Or, create individual components in bulk from a selection of objects.
Create a single component
There are a few ways to create a component. First, you'll need to select the layers you'd like to include in the component.
Select the layers you’d like to be included in the component.
You then have a few different methods for create a component:
Click the
next to the selection's name in the properties panel >
Create component.
Right-click on your selection and choose
Create component
Use the keyboard shortcuts:
Mac
⌥ Option
⌘ Command
Windows
Ctrl
Alt
Figma will nest the layers within a special component frame
Identify components in the
Layers
panel using the purple
icon.
the right sidebar, click
Component configuration
next to the component name to add a
Description
and
Documentation link
for collaborators.
Collaborators and developers can view
descriptions and documentation in various places
Tip!
Figma will create a custom button if you add a link from any of the following domains:
Github
Notion
Storybook
Zeroheight
Confluence
Dropbox Paper
Create components in bulk
By default, the
Create component
action will create a single component from your selection.
You can also create components in bulk. This allows you to select multiple groups or frames and create components out of them. Create multiple components from:
Objects and layers in frames
Objects and layers in groups
Single layers, like a path or vector network
Layers in a boolean operation
Note:
If you select more than one layer that isn't on one of the above configurations, Figma will create a component for each individual layer.
Select the layers you want to create components from,
Click
next to the selection's name in the properties panel.
Select
Create Multiple components
from the options.
Figma will create a component for each frame, group, boolean operation, or path.
Tip!
You can hand off components for development without reorganizing your file.
Create a section for your component
. Then,
mark the section as
Ready for dev
Delete a component
You can delete a component at any time.
Deleting a main component does not remove instances of that component from your files.
Select the component you want to delete.
Press
delete
Restore a component
If you have an existing instance of a deleted component, you can use that instance to restore the component.
Learn more about instances →
There are a few ways to restore a component from an instance:
From the right sidebar
Select an existing instance of the deleted component.
Do one of the following to restore the component:
If you are in the library file that contained the main component, click the
Restore Component
button from the properties panel in the right sidebar.
If you are in a file that did not contain the main component, click the
Go to main component in library
icon. Then click the
Restore
button in the dialog window.
From the right-click menu
Right-click on the instance in the canvas.
Do one of the following to restore the component:
If you are in the library file that contained the main component, hover over the
Main component
option and click
Restore main component
If you are in a file that did not contain the main component, click
Go to main component
. Then click the
Restore
button in the dialog window.
