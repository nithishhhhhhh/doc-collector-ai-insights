==================================================

Before you Start
Who can use this feature
Supported on
any team or plan.
Anyone with
edit access
to a file can add or adjust blend modes
Blend modes allow you to define how you want two layers to blend together. This involves taking the pixels from each layer and applying calculations to them.
Blend modes allow you to adjust aspects of an image, like the background color. Or, create interesting overlays and textures.
You can adjust the blend mode of an entire layer, or an individual fill.
A frame or section with a blend mode applied will blend with layers nested inside of it. For other layers, a layer with a blend mode applied will affect any layers behind it.
