Anyone with can view or can edit access to the file can view prototype flows and connections. This applies to anyone who views or accesses the file without explicit edit permissions.
People with view access can see interactions between variants in a component set (interactive components). Viewers can only see variant interactions on main components, not instances.
Note:
There isn't currently a way to share a file with prototype connections turned on by default for viewers.
View access
Viewers can access all prototype connections on the current page, including any flows and starting points.
To view connections on another page, viewers can select another page in the left sidebar.
Connections and interactions
