Find the components or assets that you're looking for with Figma AI, so you can get started faster, stay in the flow, and make space for more creativity.
For example:
Get inspired through related designs and see how others are thinking about a design problem
Browse through past explorations to help finish an in-progress design
Find the latest source of truth for a component
There are two ways to use AI in search:
Find similar designs
: Use descriptive prompts, an image, or a canvas selection to find related components and designs.
Assets tab
: Use a keyword search to find components without needing to remember their exact names.

Find components from the Figma tab
Figma uses AI to return smarter results and help you find what you’re looking for, so you don’t have to remember the name of that one component.
Without AI
Without AI, Figma tries to match your search terms to exact keywords in a component’s name or description. For example, if you searched
arrow
Figma would only return components with the word “arrow” in its name or description.
With AI
With AI, Figma looks for exact names as well as related components. For example, searching
arrow
would return components with “arrow” in their name and descriptions, as well as components that are similar in form or function.
You can search for assets either from the assets tab in the left panel, or by using
Actions
from the toolbar.
