Who can use this feature
Available on
all plans
You can customize your preferences for design files the
Zoom/view options
menu. Adjust your zoom settings, or toggle on other view options like layout guides or multiplayer cursors.
Access the
Zoom/view options
menu from the right sidebar.
Canvas zoom settings
There are a number of ways to adjust canvas zoom in design files. Any changes you make to zoom only apply in the current tab for that file.
When you first open a file, the default zoom level will be set to
Zoom to fit
. This focuses the viewport so you can see everything on the current page.
Note:
These zoom settings only apply to layers and objects on the canvas. If you're using the desktop app, you can
adjust the scale of Figma's interface
, which includes the toolbar, and the left and right sidebars. If you're using Figma in a browser, you can use your browser's zoom settings to adjust the size of the interface.
Zoom percentages
View the current zoom percentage in the top-right corner of the right sidebar.
Click to open the
Zoom/view options
menu.
Figma focuses on the current percentage field. Start typing to enter a specific percentage.
Select one of the default zoom percentages:
Zoom to 50%
Zoom to 100%
Zoom to 200%

Tip:
If you are opening a Figma URL that links to a specific node, the canvas will be zoomed to fit that specific node.
Mouse and trackpad gestures
You can also use your mouse or trackpad to zoom the canvas.
On both
Mac and Windows trackpads
, you can use the following gestures to adjust zoom:
Stretch two fingers apart to zoom in
Pinch two fingers together to zoom out
On an
Apple Magic Mouse
Hold down ⌘ Command (Mac) or Ctrl (Windows) and scroll up and down
Double-tap with one finger to zoom in and back out
another type of mouse
Hold down
⌘ Command
(Mac) or
Ctrl
(Windows) and scroll the mouse wheel up to zoom in, or down to zoom out.
Pixel preview
By default, vectors in Figma are rendered as resolution-independent. This means that there aren't fixed resolutions for the paths you create in the canvas.
To support pixel-precise editing, you can enable pixel preview. This allows you to preview vector objects in their rasterized format.
You can view pixel preview in either 1x or 2x mode. This allows you to preview how objects will appear on both low and high resolution displays.
To enable Pixel preview:
Open the
Zoom/view options
menu.
Hover over the
Pixel preview
option to open the menu.
Select either
from the options.
A checkmark will appear next to the setting in the menu. You will also see a notification at the bottom of your screen to confirm Pixel preview is enabled.
To disable pixel preview:
Select the
Zoom/view options
menu in the toolbar.
Hover over the
Pixel preview
option.
Select
Disabled
from the options.
Tip:
You can also use the shortcut to toggle pixel preview off and on:
Mac:
⌃Control
Windows:
Control
Alt
Pixel grid
For greater accuracy when placing and aligning objects, you can enable the
pixel grid
. Each square in the pixel grid represents a single pixel, when exported at 1x resolution.
Open the
Zoom/view options
menu.
If there is no check next to it: select
Pixel grid
to toggle this on.
If there is already a check next to
Pixel grid
, you can click it again to toggle it off.
You can also use the keyboard shortcuts to toggle the pixel grid off and on:
Mac:
⌘Command
Windows:
Ctrl
Snap to pixel grid
The pixel grid is only visible at zoom levels of 400% or higher. If you want to use the pixel grid while zoomed out, the
Snap to pixel grid
setting is a great tool.
When you enable this functionality, we will align objects to the underlying grid when placing or moving them. This can help to prevent mis-aligned pixel errors when exporting elements.
Note:
Frames, sections, and components always snap to the pixel grid, even if
Snap to pixel grid
is disabled.
To toggle snap to pixel grid, open the
Zoom/view options
menu (from the zoom level in the toolbar) and select
Snap to pixel grid.
Or use keyboard shortcut:
Mac:
⌘Command
⇧ Shift
Windows:
Control
⇧ Shift
Tip:
You can temporarily disable
Snap to pixel grid
by holding
Control
while in
vector edit mode
and zoomed in to the canvas.
To know if you’ve zoomed in to the canvas enough, turn on the pixel grid
⇧ Shift
and zoom in until the grid is visible. You can disable the pixel grid at anytime as it isn’t needed to disable snap to pixel grid.
Layout guides
You can toggle the visibility of all layout guides in your files, from the
Zoom/view options
menu. This is great if you'd like to preview how a design will look, without having to remove or hide layout guides for individual objects.
Open the
Zoom/view options
menu.
If there is no check next to the
Layout guides
option, click to display them:
If there is a check already showing, clicking
Layout guides
will hide them:
You can also use the keyboard shortcuts to toggle layout guides:
Mac:
Control
Windows:
Ctrl
Shift

Multiplayer cursors
If you're collaborating with other team members in a file, you will be able to see their actions via the Multiplayer cursors. Collaborator names and cursors are shown next to their location on the canvas.
If you don't want to be distracted by other team member's actions, you can hide their cursors from your view.
Open the
Zoom/view options
menu.
If there is no check next to the
Multiplayer cursors
option, click to display them.
If there is a check already showing, click
Multiplayer cursors
again to hide.
You can also use the keyboard shortcut
Option-Command-\
to toggle multiplayer cursors.
Prototype flows
A prototype is the network of frames and connections in a single page. Prototypes can map out a user's entire journey through your app or website, or can focus on a specific segment or flow.
Learn more about prototyping →
If you only have
can view
access to a file, you can't create prototypes or make changes to an existing prototype. However, you can still view existing prototype connections by toggling the
Prototyping
view option.
In the toolbar, click the current zoom percentage to open your view options menu.
Select
Prototyping
to toggle prototype connections on or off.
Note:
If you have edit access to the file, you won’t have the
Prototyping
setting in your view options. Instead, you can view prototype flows by switching to the
Prototype
tab.
