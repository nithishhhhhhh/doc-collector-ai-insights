==================================================

Before you Start
Who can use this feature
Available on
all paid plans
View history displays a log of every logged-in team and organization member or invited guest who has visited your file, along with time passed since their most recent visit. This helps your team collaborate asynchronously and confirm who has seen your file. This setting applies to Figma Design, FigJam, and Figma Slides.
Note:
Viewer history for files is not available for visits to a file before this feature launched February 2025.
Here’s how it works:
Logged-in collaborators in the same team or organization, including invited guests, are recorded as having viewed the file and are shown viewer history for the file
Visitors to a file from a public link, open session, or those outside your team or organization will not be recorded in view history and can only see current viewers
Tip:
If you want to prevent logged-out users or people outside your team or organization to view your file,
adjust the file’s access and permissions
See viewer history
To see who has viewed your file, click your avatar in the right sidebar. The dropdown will show you who is
Currently viewing
your file and anyone who
Previously viewed
your file. Hover over a person’s name and click the
ellipsis to view their profile.
Change your viewer settings
If you want to opt out of being recorded as a viewer on files for all teams and organizations you are part of, you can do so from your account settings. This setting is enabled to your entire account and can’t be managed on a team or organization basis.
To do so:
Open Figma in the file browser.
Select your avatar in the top-left corner to open the account menu.
Select
Settings
to open the settings modal.
Go to
Account
View history
> and click
Change preference
Select
Off
At this point, your future file viewing history will no longer be recorded or visible to others. You also won’t be able to see your teammates’ file history going forward. Existing viewer history is not removed from files visited before opting out.
