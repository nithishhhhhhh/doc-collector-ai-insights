==================================================

Before you start
Who can use this feature
Supported for files in
Education, Professional, Organization, and Enterprise teams
Anyone part of a
paid team
can add video to files.
Anyone with
can edit
access can edit videos in files.
New to Prototyping? Check out our
Guide to prototyping →
Add video to your prototypes to replicate the experience your users would have in a site or app with video playback or previews.
Video in prototypes:
Can be in .mp4 or .mov format using H.264 encoding.
Can be in .webm format using VP8 encoding.
Can be up to 100MB in size
Are
shape fills
and behave as such
Are not currently supported in the
Figma mobile app
Note:
Video can only be added to files in a paid Education, Professional, and Organization team. Collaborators on free Starter teams can edit existing video in a file but not upload video to it.
Once you add video(s) to your design file, you can edit or adjust basic video qualities. Then, you can add interactions to your videos to start building your prototypes.
Add video to files
Figma doesn't have a specific layer type for video, instead, videos are a type of fill. Since videos are fills, you can add them to any vector or shape.
There are a number of ways you can add video to design files:
Drag and drop video file from your computer onto the canvas.
Use the video importer from the fill color picker.
Learn more about how to upload fills →
Use the Place image/video tool to add videos in bulk.

Copy a video from another layer in the current file, or from another file.
Paste any video from your clipboard into the canvas.
Note:
You can also add animated GIFs to your prototypes. GIFs only playback when viewing designs and prototypes in presentation view.
Add animated GIFs to prototypes →
If you add a video straight to the canvas, Figma creates an object on the canvas with the dimensions of the original file. If you add a video as a fill to an existing object, Figma uses the name and dimensions of the original object.
View and update video fills in the
Fill
section of the right sidebar. From the
Fill
section, you can play and preview your video fill, jump to a specific timestamp, or scrub through the video.
You can also identify layers with video fills in the Layers panel in the left sidebar. Objects with video fills are represented on the layers panel with the
icon.
Edit video
Once you’ve added a video to your file, you can edit the video in the following ways:
Scale, rotate and adjust the dimensions of any layers with video
Crop and re-position video applied to layers
Adjust the video options including the Fill mode, rotation and
blend modes
Apply masks
to only show a part of the video
Prototype with video
Once you add video to a frame, switch over to the
Prototype
of the right sidebar. From here, you can create interactions between frames with video.

Video properties
When you select a video, there is a
Video
section available on the Prototype tab. This section lets you set a video’s behavior when navigating to its frame in a prototype.
Check the box to
autoplay
video
Click the
Loop
icon
to loop video
Click the
Sound
icon
to turn the video’s default sound setting on or off
Video interactions
When you create any prototyping connection, there is a
trigger
that determines what causes the interaction to begin, and an
action
that defines the response from the triggered event.
The following interaction triggers are available for videos:
When video hits
- Trigger set action when the video hits a specific timestamp.
When video ends
- Trigger set action when the video completes playing.
The following interaction actions are available for videos:
Play/pause video
- Select either
Play video
Pause video
, or
Toggle play/pause
Mute/unmute video
- Select either
Mute video
Unmute video
Toggle mute/unmute
Set to specific time
- Set a timestamp to jump to in the video.
Jump forward/backward in time
- Select either
Jump forward
Jump backward
, then set the number of seconds to jump forward/backward in the video.
When you create an interaction between two frames that have the same video, there is a
Reset video state
toggle in the
Interaction details
panel. When toggled on, the video will restart from its beginning between frames.

Video interactions within the same frame
You can interact and prototype with videos based on triggers made within the same frame. This can be helpful when trying to build an interactive video player experience.
Create a connection from your starting object to the video file.
Set your desired starting action (for example,
On click
Set your desired action for the video (for example,
Mute/unmute video
Video and smart animate
You can
use smart animate
to preserve a video’s progress when navigating between frames. Let’s say you want to create a prototype where entering a frame begins playback, then clicking on the video navigates to a new frame with a larger view.
Create a connection between the two frames with the same video name. Make sure the video layer names match as well.
Set the animation setting to
Smart animate
In the
Interaction details
panel, uncheck
Reset video states.
Video and interactive components
Use interactive components to prototype video interactions in a single frame, like previewing playback on hover.
Create a component with variants
for a default and hover state.
The default state should have autoplay off, and the hover state should be set to autoplay.
Create a connection from the default variant to
change to
the hover variant and uncheck
Reset video states.
Create a frame with a couple instances of the component and replace video to reuse the component.
