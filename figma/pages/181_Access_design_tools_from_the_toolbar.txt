==================================================

Before you start
Who can use this feature
Users on
any team or plan
can access the toolbar in Figma Design files.
Users will need
can edit
access to use every tool in the toolbar. Users with
can view
access can use some functions in the toolbar.
The toolbar is your hub for interacting with—and adding objects—to the canvas. Here is an overview of the different tools in the toolbar.
Move, Hand, and Scale
When you open a design file, Figma selects the
Move
tool by default. Click the
arrow to the right of the
Move
tool to access the
Hand
and
Scale
tools.
Move
: Select and move objects around on the canvas
Hand
: Click around a file without selecting and moving objects
Scale
Resize entire objects or layers
If you're using Figma on a device with a touch screen, the
Hand
tool lets you pan around a file using your fingers.
Tip
: You can press and hold the space bar to temporarily activate the
Hand
tool.
Frame, Section, and Slice
The
Frame
tool is selected by default. Click the
arrow to access the
Section
and
Slice
tools.
Frame
Frames
are the main building blocks of Figma. A frame is a container that holds design elements such as shapes, text, and images. You can use them to organize and structure design elements on the canvas. Create a frame with your own dimensions in the canvas, or select a frame size from Figma's presets in the properties panel on the right-hand side of the screen.
Section:
Sections
let you organize files for easier navigation, link others to a collection of designs, or mark content as "Ready for development" to help with the developer handoff.
Slice:
The
Slice
tool allows you to specify a region of the screen you want to export.
Shape
The
Shape
tool gives you a number of default shapes to use. The
Rectangle
tool is selected by default. Click the
arrow to choose from:
Rectangle
Line
Arrow
Ellipse
Polygon
Star
Place Image
Tip
Place Image
lets you select one or more images on your computer and insert them on the canvas. In Figma, an image is
imported as a fill on a shape
, which is why
Place Image
is located in the
Shape
tool.
Pen and Pencil
Pen
: Create vector shapes and icons. You can build complex
Vector Networks
using vector paths, anchor points, and bezier curves.
Pencil
: Add freehand drawings or annotations to your design files. Figma will apply some basic smoothing to any paths you create with the
Pencil
tool. Select a drawing and press the Enter / Return key to edit the drawing in Vector Edit mode.
Text
Text
is one of the crucial components of interface design. Everything from the placement and arrangement of text, to the choice of font, has a part to play.
Select the
Text
tool, or press the
key to add text layers to your file.
Click once in the canvas to add a text layer that grows horizontally
Click and drag to create a text layer with a fixed size

Comment
The
Comment
tool lets you annotate the canvas with your thoughts, ideas, and feedback.
Use comments to give or respond to feedback
, tweak your designs, and iterate faster—all without leaving the design file. Comments are accessible to anyone with view or edit access to the file.
Actions menu
The
Actions
menu is a collection of productivity tools in design files to help you stay in the flow. From here, you can access:
AI tools
, like generating a design, replacing content, or creating images

for finding library assets by name or by description
Plugins
and
widgets
