Paints are colors, gradients, or images. Fills are just one of the ways you can use paints in Figma.
Apply paints to text layers, or any vector object, this includes shapes, vector networks, and boolean groups. You can add, adjust, and remove fills in the
Fill
section of the right sidebar.
Add fills
Add fills to text layers, frames, and any vector objects. You can even add more than one fill to a single layer. This allows you to layer gradients over images, or apply blend modes to create unique effects.
We treat each fill as a unique layer, so you can adjust the properties individually. You can even toggle the visibility of each fill independently.
Select the layer(s) you want to add a fill to.
In the
Fill
section of the right sidebar, click the
icon to add a fill to the layer.
Figma will add a default
Solid
fill with a hex value of
C4C4C4
. Click on the fill swatch to open the color picker:
From the color picker you can select a paint type, choose a color, and apply blend modes.

Adjust fills

panel of the right sidebar.
