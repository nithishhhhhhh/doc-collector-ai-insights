Alignment
Alignment determines how Figma distributes text within the bounding box. There are two alignment settings, one for each axis,
horizontal
and
vertical
Horizontal
Vertical
Horizontal alignment
defines how to align the text along the
x axis (horizontal)
. Use the icons to select the horizontal alignment. Choose from:
Left
Center
Right
Justify*
Justify
aligns the first word in each line of text to the left-most edge, and the last to the right-most edge. Figma spaces each word in a line of justified text uniformly.
Vertical alignment
aligns text along the
y axis (vertical)
. Use the alignment icons to select a vertical alignment. Choose from:
Top
Middle
Bottom
Note:
It's only possible to vertically align text in text layers with a
Fixed Size
. Layers with resizing set to Auto Width or Auto Height will ignore alignment.
Decoration
Apply text decoration to an entire text layer, or to selected text. You have two types of decoration available:
Strikethrough
Underline
Strikethrough
Underline
Strikethrough adds a horizontal line through the center of your text.
Use strikethrough to indicate obsolete or inaccurate information. This allows you to convey its state, without redacting or obscuring the original text.
Click the
icon to apply strikethrough to selected text.
Underline adds a horizontal line along the baseline of your text. Use underline to place emphasis on a particular section of the text, or show that it includes a link.
Underlining links is considered good practice in web design. If applied consistently, this can help to improve the accessibility of your design.
Click the
icon to apply underline to selected text, or use the keyboard shortcut:
Mac:
Option
Windows:
Ctrl
You can then access additional underline settings. From
Type settings
, select
the chevron to view and adjust
Underline details:
Style
: Select a solid, dotted, or wavy underline style.
Thickness
: Adjust the width of the underline.
Offset
: Adjust the distance of the underline text from its original position
Skip ink:
Adjust the behavior of the underline when the line passes through part of a letter or glyph. When enabled, the underline will skip areas where the part of a glyph character crosses an underline.
Color
: The color of the underline.
Font family, weight, size
Font family
Font weight or style
Font size
There are a few terms associated with a font:
typeface
is a set of letterforms and glyphs with similar design features.
font
is a file containing the visual details that make up the design of each glyph or letter in that typeface.
font family
is the collection of styles that make up a typeface. For example: Helvetica, Times New Roman, and Roboto are all font families.
Figma will use
Inter
as the default font for new text layers in a session. You can
select another font family using the font picker
. Click the arrow to explore styles for the selected font.
A typeface can have any number of styles or weights. Every font family will come with its own selection of styles. For example, a few font weights from the Inter font family include thin, light, regular, medium, bold, black, and more.
You can access weights once you select the font family. Adjust the font-weight using the field directly below the font family.
Click the arrow to explore styles for the selected font.
Use the keyboard shortcuts to increase and decrease the font-weight.
Mac:
Hold down
⌥ Option
⌘ Command
and
to increase or
to decrease.
Windows:
Hold down
Ctrl
Alt
and
to increase or
to decrease.
Font size controls the scale of your text. Figma represents font size in density-independent pixels.
Adjust the font size using the field next to the font style. There are a few ways to adjust font size:
Click the arrow to select a default font size.
Enter your own number in the field.
Use the keyboard shortcuts:
Mac:
Hold down
Shift
⌘ Command
and
to increase or
to decrease.
Windows:
Hold down
Ctrl
Shift
and
to increase or
to decrease.
Figma represents text sizes in a few different ways
If you're translating your designs to code, your screen resolution will determine the actual size of any text. You can view the CSS
pixel value (px)
of any text in the
Typography
section in Dev Mode.
You can also view these values in the
Properties
panel if you have view access to the file and don't use Dev Mode.
If you're exporting your designs to PDF, Figma will render font size using
traditional print points
(pt).
Hanging quotes
Toggle hanging quotes to move a text layer's opening quotation marks outside of the bounding box.
Hanging lists
Toggle hanging lists to move bullet points or numbers of each list item outside of the bounding box. This aligns text content with the bounding box.
Letter case
Letter case allows you to change the case of selected text. This is super handy when you want to switch between cases without having to delete and retype your text. Choose from:
Uppercase
: transforms text to
UPPER CASE
Lowercase
: transforms text to
lower case
Capitalize
: transforms the first character of every word to upper case. You may know this as
Title Case
Small Caps
: transform text to
MALL CAPS
. This displays uppercase letters inline with lowercase letters. While this looks like an UPPERCASE transformation, it's a little different. Small Caps characters usually have different proportions (for example, weight or aspect ratio).
Letter spacing
Letter spacing
lets you define the space between characters in a word, line, or paragraph. This can determine how easy your text is to read.
This is not to be confused with
kerning
, which refers to the process of adjusting space between individual characters in a typeface.
Adjust the letter spacing for an entire text layer, or a selection of text. To replicate kerning, place the cursor between two letters and adjust the letter spacing.
Use the
field to adjust letter spacing for your selection, or use the keyboard shortcuts:
Mac
: Hold down
⌥ Option
and
to increase or
to decrease.
Windows
: Hold down
Alt
and
to increase or
to decrease.
If you select text with different letter spacing values, Figma will scale the letter spacing proportionally.
Tip!
Tracking describes the letter spacing process in the manual printing process and is usually represented in 1/1000em. One unit of tracking (1/1000em) is approximately equal to 0.001em letter-spacing (CSS). You can use this formula to convert tracking to letter spacing:
letter spacing = tracking/1000
Line height
Line height
allows you to control the vertical distance between lines of text in a paragraph. This can help to balance designs and improve the readability of your copy. This is the same as
line spacing
Small line heights can make text difficult to read. Large line heights can make text look messy and disjointed.
Use the
field to adjust the vertical space between lines of text, or use the keyboard shortcuts:
Mac:
Hold down
⇧ Shift
⌥ Option
and
to increase or
to decrease.
Windows:
Hold down
Alt
Shift
and
to increase or
to decrease.
You can also view these values in the
Properties
panel, under
Typography
, if you have view access to the file and don't use Dev Mode.
Figma allows you to set a
fixed line height in pixels (px)
or a line height that's a
percentage of the font size (%)
By default, line height is set to
Auto
. This is calculated using the font's default line height, which varies between typefaces.
You can switch between fixed and percentage line heights and Figma will convert the value for you, to the nearest pixel.
Translating line height:
Each platform has a different way of representing line height. Figma includes values and measurements for each platform in Dev Mode.
You can also view alternative units of measurement. For line height this means both a fixed line height in pixels and as a percentage of the font size.
Lists
Lists are a great way to organize and emphasize related information. List items in Figma can either be ordered or unordered in the form of a numbered or bulleted list.
Learn more about creating bulleted or numbered lists →
List spacing
List spacing
lets you control the distance between each line item in a bulleted or numbered list. By default, list spacing is set to
when creating a new list and for any existing text styles. Figma represents list spacing in pixels (px).
To adjust list item spacing:
Select text in a list or a text layer with only list text.
Enter a px value in the
List spacing
field. Or hover above the icon and drag to
decrease (left)
increase (right)
the value.
You can also adjust list spacing from the
Type details
panel by clicking
in the
Typography
section of the right sidebar.
Numbers
The number section includes any properties or features for numerical figures. The properties in this section will depend on the font family you are using.
Fractions
Position (subscript and superscript)
Slashed Zero
Style
Create
fractions
from numbers. Enter a fraction as
X/X
and click the
to turn it into a fraction.
Use
subscript
superscript
to offset the position of numbers and characters.
Subscript characters are positioned below the line the type. Superscript characters are positioned above the line of type. Both default to a smaller size than the rest of the text.
Faux typography
When you apply superscript/subscript to text, Figma tries to use any superscript/subscript glyphs provided by the font. If it isn’t provided, Figma draws a synthesized version by using the font's standard version of the character, shrinking it, and positioning it accordingly.
This is often called “
faux typography
Also, if you mix available and unavailable superscript/subscript glyphs in the same text layer, they’ll all update to the synthesized form for consistency.
Use
slashed zero
to display the zero integer with a slash through it. This is another way to distinguish it from the letter O.
Style options include proportional figures and monospace figures.
Proportional
figures have varying spacing depending on the width of the character being used.
Monospace
figures, also known as tabular figures, have the same width regardless of the character being used.
Both figures are offered in uppercase (also called lining style) or lowercase (also called old-style).
Proportional uppercase/lining
Proportional lowercase/old-style
Monospace uppercase/lining
Monospace lowercase/old-style
OpenType features
OpenType can refer to a format or a set of features or functions available in a font. In Figma Design, we're referring to the OpenType features that a font supports.
Figma supports OpenType features
across all fonts. But its worth mentioning that not all fonts support the same OpenType features. Supported features can include settings like: letterforms, stylistic sets, character variants, horizontal spacing, and more.
Paragraph indent
Paragraph indentation offsets the text in the
first line
to the right. You can only apply paragraph indentation to text that uses the horizontal alignment setting
Text-align left
Figma represents paragraph indentation as a
pixel (px)
value. Use the
Paragraph Indent
field to adjust paragraph indentation.
A good rule of thumb is to avoid indentations greater than 4 x the font size. We also recommend taking the width of the text layer into account - the wider the layer, the larger the indentation.
Note:
Paragraph indentation applies to all paragraphs in a text layer. If you wish to indent a single paragraph, you will need to create a separate text layer for it.
Paragraph spacing
Paragraph spacing lets you control the distance between paragraphs. This can increase or reduce the whitespace around text in your design. White space can help to focus the viewer's attention, as well as increase legibility and readability.
Figma represents paragraph in
pixels (px)
. Enter a px value in the
Paragraph spacing
field. Or hover above the icon and drag to
decrease (left)
increase (right)
the value.
Note:
Figma will create a new paragraph when you use the
Enter
Return
keys. This is something to bear in mind if your
text resizing
is set to
Auto Width
Text truncation and max lines
Truncate text
hides text that overflows the bounding box. An ellipsis
...
is added at the end of the text to indicate hidden overflow text.
Max lines
allows you to set the number of lines of text before it truncates. Max lines is available only if truncate text is enabled, and:
Text resizing is set to
auto height
auto width
Vertical resizing is set to
hug contents
(for text living in auto layout frames)
Vertical trim
Use vertical trim to remove the extra space above and below text. This allows text layers to behave like other components in your layout by removing ambiguity around the bounding box of text content.
This can help with handoff by making it easier to parse CSS margin and padding values with accurate pixel measurements that match your designs.
Vertical trim in Dev Mode
If vertical trim is enabled on a text layer, you’ll see
leading-trim: both;
in the
Typography
section in Dev Mode.
Vertical trim translates to two CSS properties in Dev Mode:
leading-trim
and
text-edge
. It’s worth noting that both of these properties are draft features that aren’t widely supported by web browsers.
This setting won’t change the measurements or properties of the text layer, but it may change the final dimensions of its parent layer.
