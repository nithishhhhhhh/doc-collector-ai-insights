This is one step in the branching process. For more information on branching, check out our
Guide to branching
There are a few steps involved in receiving updates and merging changes. And while uncommon, it’s possible for something to go wrong at one of those steps.
If it does, you may find yourself in a situation where a merge or update didn't complete. We’re working on improvements that will reduce the chances of this happening.
In the meantime, there are a few things you can do if something doesn’t look right after a merge or update.
Issues
Problem
Solution
Updates from a previous merge show up as conflicts you still need to resolve. This means a previous update from main didn’t complete.
You have two options available:
Repeat the process by
resolving the conflicts
Restore the branch ↓
to a version before the failed update. You can restore from the
Before update
checkpoint in the branch’s version history.
Changes from the branch have been applied to the main file, but the branch hasn’t been closed.
If all your changes have been successfully applied, you can
archive the branch
Not all changes from the branch are applied to the main file.
Restore the main file ↓
to a version before the failed merge. Then repeat the merge process.
You accidentally merged changes from a branch, or want to undo your changes.
You can
restore a previous version of the main file ↓
Restore an earlier version of a branch
Tip!
You can identify a branch by looking out for this structure next to the file name:
File name
Branch name

Caution:
Restoring a previous version applies to everyone with access to the main file. This won’t preserve any other changes made to the main file, including other branch merges.
Note:
Reversing or undoing a merge won’t restore an archived branch. You’ll need to
restore the branch
before trying to merge the branch again.
