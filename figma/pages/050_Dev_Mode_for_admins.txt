==================================================

Dev Mode in Figma gives developers everything they need to navigate design files and transform designs into code. With Dev Mode, designers and developers can stay on the same page, making sure important details aren’t lost in the handoff process.
Developers use Dev Mode to:
Access advanced inspection capabilities and more codegen languages
See what’s changed since you last viewed a file by comparing frame versions
Quickly review designs that are ready for development with statuses and annotations
Streamline your workflow with developer-focused integrations, like JIRA, Storybook and GitHub
Explore design system components in a playground
Connect designs with links to tickets, documentation, and components in code

Not everyone in your organization might require the
advanced features that come with Dev Mode
. The developers who don’t can still use Figma Design with a free View seat and do basic inspection like viewing properties and measurements, copying code, and exporting assets. As an admin, you can manage users who need View seats in Figma Design from the admin panel, just like you managed for Dev seats.
