Organize your canvas with labeled sections to group related ideas and guide collaborators through your file.
Sections let you:

Organize files for easier navigation
Link to a grouping of designs
Mark content as "Ready for development" to help with the developer handoff
Sections in Figma Design are a top-level element on the canvas by default. Sections can contain all layer types, including other sections, but cannot be contained within frames or groups.

Share a section
You can direct collaborators to a specific section in your canvas by copying the link to that section.
Select the section you want to share.
Click
Share
in the right sidebar.
Mark a section as ready for development
Once content inside a section is finalized, you can mark the section as ready for development. This helps developers using Dev Mode by flagging the section for them.
To mark a section as ready for development:
Select the section.
Click
Mark as ready for dev
To unmark a section as ready for dev, click the
three dot menu in the
Ready for dev
label and select
Remove ready status
Note:
Marking a section as ready for development does not prevent changes from being made to content in that section.
Update the dev status
After you’ve marked the a section
Ready for dev
, if you make changes to the design, Figma automatically changes the dev status to
Changed.
The
Changed
status helps developers keep track of designs that iterate after being marked as ready for development.
To resolve the changed status for a section, click the
Changed
status indicator and enter a reason for the change. After, the dev status is returned to
Ready for dev

Prototype with sections
In prototypes, sections help connect flows across different portions of your design.
When you create a connection to a section, Figma remembers the last visited frame of that section and automatically returns to it.
