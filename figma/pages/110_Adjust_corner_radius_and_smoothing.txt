Before you start
Who can use this feature
Available on
any plan
Anyone with
can edit
access to a file can adjust corner radius and smoothing
In interface design, we see rounded corners on screens, icons, buttons, and cards. It's easier for eyes to follow circles and curves, while sharp edges disrupt our line of sight.
Figma represents corner radius in (density-independent) pixels. You can adjust corner radius for an entire shape, or for each point in a vector object.
Figma has two features for creating rounded corners:
Corner radius:
Rounds the corner where two lines meet. Use this to create shapes with rounded corners.
Corner smoothing:
Adjusts a rounded corner to create a continuous curve. Use this setting to create "squircles".
Note:
Rounded corners may not be available for rectangles you create with the pen tool or rectangles you edit in vector edit mode.
You can apply corner radius and smoothing to:
Frames
Rectangles, polygons, and stars
Vector networks that are closed shapes
Boolean operations that contain rectangles
Note:
It's not possible to apply corner radius to lines, arrows, vector networks with only a single stroke, or boolean operations that only contain ellipses.
Adjust corner radius for an entire shape
There are a few ways to adjust the corner radius for a vector object or shape.
Tip:
Your S
mall nudge
and B
ig nudge
settings apply to corner radius too. Use the
and
keys to use your small nudge. Hold down
Shift
to use your big nudge settings with the arrow keys.
Design tab
Select the layer.
Enter a pixel value in the
Corner radius
field in the right sidebar or hover your cursor over the
icon, then click and drag left to reduce or right to increase.
Canvas
You can also adjust the corner radius for rectangles, stars, and polygons on the canvas.
Select the shape you want to update.
Hover over the corner you want adjust until the radius handle appears.
Drag to adjust the radius.
Adjust the radius of an individual corner
By default, Figma applies corner radius to the entire shape. There are a few ways to adjust the corner radius for individual corners.
Caution:
It's not possible to adjust an individual corner's radius in an instance. This is something to think about when setting corner radius for components.
Independent corners setting (rectangles and frames only)
Select the rectangle or frame you want to update.
Click
Independent corners
in the right sidebar.
In the
Corner radius details
panel, you can:
Enter a pixel value for each corner
Click
Apply variable
in any of the four corner radius fields to
apply a number variable
Use the slider to adjust
corner smoothing
Canvas (rectangles only)
You can also adjust the corner radius for an individual corner in the canvas. This only applies to rectangles.
Select the shape you want to update.
Hold down the modifier key to adjust a single corner.
Mac:
⌥ Option
Windows:
Alt
Hover over the corner you want adjust until the radius handle appears.
Drag to adjust the radius.
Vector edit mode (shapes only)
Select the shape you want to update.
Double-click on the shape or press
Enter
Return
to enter vector edit mode.
Select the individual point on the canvas.
Adjust the corner radius using the
field in the right sidebar.
Enter a pixel value in the
Corner radius
field or hover your cursor over the
icon, then click and drag left to reduce and right to increase.
Corner smoothing for squircles
Designers noticed a difference in the rounded corners of iOS7 app icons. This corner smoothing created a seamless continuous curve that regular rounded corners couldn't.
We refer to shapes that use this particular effect squircles. A shape that's somewhere between a square and a circle. We still see squircles in Apple's later designs, including OS14.
There's quite a bit of mathematics that goes into a squircle. Learn more about
one Figma engineer's search for squircles
Adjust corner smoothing
You can apply corner smoothing to any shape you can apply corner radius to. Unlike corner radius, you can only apply corner smoothing to the entire shape.
Select the layer you want to update.
Open the
Design
panel in the right sidebar.
Click the
Independent corners
icon to open the
Corner radius
panel.
Use the slider to adjust corner smoothing or click
iOS
to set corner smoothing to 60%, the default for iOS.
