Full or Dev seat
Dev resources are a great way for anyone to add external documentation that can help developers better understand and build a component. Dev resources can be linked to objects in Figma Design and are often related to the documentation or source code. Use Dev resources to:
Link a GitHub file to a component for quick access to the source code
Assign a Jira ticket to a specific part of a mockup
Connect Storybook to view stories in Figma
Note:
If an attached dev resource has a related plugin available, clicking the link will automatically launch it in the
Plugins
tab.
Link to a Dev resource
Dev resources can be added to any layer on the canvas. If a dev resource is added to a component, the link is inherited by all instances of that component. If a dev resource is added to an instance of a component, the link will only appear for that instance.
To link to a dev resource:
Copy the URL you want to add.
In Dev Mode, select a layer on the canvas.
In the inspect panel, click
Layer options
, and then
Add a dev resource link
In the box that appears in the inspect panel, paste the link.
Press
Enter
Remove a linked Dev resource
In the inspect panel
click
Additional options
next to the link to the resource.
Select
Delete link
Note:
Dev resources with related plugins may have different ways of detaching a link from a layer.
