takes collaboration to the next level. You can use comments to respond to feedback, tweak your designs and iterate faster—all from the original design file.
You and your team can

You can edit the content of any comment you've posted. This is handy if you've noticed a typo, want to add a clarification, or
mention a collaborator

Click

option to edit the content of your comment.
Click

Change comment location
Comments can be pinned to a specific frame or layer, or specific co-ordinates on the canvas. This allows you to draw attention to a specific part of the canvas, whether this is a frame, object, or layer.
You can change where the comment is pinned. To move a comment:
Select the comment in the canvas, or from the right sidebar in comment mode.
Click on the comment pin in the canvas.
Drag the comment pin to its new location.
Move layers with comments
If you've pinned a comment to a specific layer, you may be able to move both the layer and its comments. Your method for moving the layer, and the layer's final destination, impact the comment's location.
Cut and paste
If you cut a layer or frame and paste this in a new location, Figma disconnects the comment from that layer. You can still view and respond to that comment from the right sidebar.
If the comment wasn't pinned to the layer, you can also access that comment from it's original co-ordinates on the canvas.
Figma won't move comments if you cut and paste layers between files. Any comments will remain as detached comments in the original file.
Move between pages
If you use the
Move to page
option to move a layer within a file, Figma also moves any comments. Right-click on the object and choose
Move to page
If the comment was linked to the canvas—not the layer or frame itself—Figma won't move the comment.
Duplicate files
If you duplicate a file, Figma won't copy comments to the new file. Comments are only kept on the original file.
