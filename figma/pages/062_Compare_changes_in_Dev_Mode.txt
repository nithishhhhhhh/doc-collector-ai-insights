Before you Start
Who can use this feature
Available on
all paid plans
Requires a
Full or Dev seat
Dev Mode allows developers to see when a frame or component was last edited and compare changes made at different points in its version history. Since the handoff between design and development can be iterative, being able to compare changes and version history brings clarity to the process. With compare changes, you can always track the latest updates and keep production code accurate.
Compare changes
If a frame or component has been updated since you last viewed it, you can compare its version history. You can also compare detached components, or instances with design overrides against the base component.
Select a top-level frame or component.
Tip:
Hold
Shift
and click to select two components on the canvas to compare them with each other.
In the Inspect tab of the right sidebar, click
Compare changes
Version history
View a timeline of the file’s history, including saved and autosaved versions. Click on a previous version to compare with the current version. Version history is only shown when comparing a top-level frame over time.
View edited layers
Under
Layers
, you can view how an asset’s individual layers have changed over time. Layer changes are labeled as one of the following:
Edited:
The layer was edited between the current and selected versions
Added:
The layer was added between the current and selected versions
Deleted:
The layer was deleted between the current and selected versions
Clicking on a layer in the list zooms in to the selected layer in the side by side or overlay view.
Side by side
A side-by-side view of the selected version and current version of an asset. Adjust the modal’s zoom settings using the
zoom in and
zoom out buttons on the right.
Overlay
An overlay view of the current frame version on top of the selected version is helpful for making smaller edits stand out. Use the slider on the right to adjust the current frame’s transparency or click
to toggle its visibility. Adjust the modal’s zoom settings using the
zoom in and
zoom out buttons on the right.
Compare code
When you select an edited layer, you can view updated code between the previous version and the current version. This is helpful for making sure your codebase is aligned with the most recent designs.
Use the dropdown to select your preferred language for the code panel, and click
to select your preferred unit.

Compare properties
When you select an edited layer, the updated properties are displayed, along with the assigned values from the previous version and the current version.
Compare changes in focus view
When focused on a design in Dev Mode, you can take advantage of the version history in the focus view to compare changes. When you compare changes, the interface is the same as detailed in
Compare changes
To compare changes while in focus view:
Open a Figma Design file.
On the canvas, for the design you want to focus on, click the dev status indicator and select
Show in focus view
While nothing is selected, the focus view displays the version history on the right side of the view.
For the version that you want to compare with the latest, click
and select
Compare to latest version
Optionally, to get a link to the focus view that you can share with others, click
