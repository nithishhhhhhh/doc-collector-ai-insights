Search for assets

Note
: If you don’t have access to the Figma AI
limited beta
yet, or if an admin has disabled Figma AI, you won’t be able to search for assets using AI—but you can still use the
Assets
view to search for components by name.
Find similar designs
Select an object on the canvas, like an image or part of a design. Then, open
Actions
and click
Find more like
to search for matching objects from across your team or organization.
If you’ve selected a screenshot, Figma will match the screenshot to the original editable designs.
Search via description
Click the
Assets
tab and enter a description to search for a component or other design.
For example, searching ‘icon that looks like a teardrop’ in Figma’s own organization surfaces the

icon.
