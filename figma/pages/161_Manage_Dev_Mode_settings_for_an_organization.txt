These settings apply to all files in an organization, excluding drafts.
Pin and unpin plugins
Pinning a plugin in Dev Mode automatically adds it to the Inspect panel for all users. If you prefer that all users have the same tools for managing tasks, inspecting designs, or generating code, pinning plugins can help your users find them more easily.
When you pin a plugin in Dev Mode in the organization, Figma will:
Automatically display the plugin in the Inspect panel in Dev Mode. It's not possible to pin plugins for a specific team or group of members.
Add the plugin to the approved list, if enabled.

in the left sidebar.
Select the

Unpin plugins for the organization
Organization admins can remove pinned Dev Mode plugins at any time. Unpinning a plugin doesn’t prevent people from using the plugin, and people can still pin the plugin to their files if they wish. To prevent organization members from using a plugin, use the
Approve plugins setting
To unpin Dev Mode plugins:
From the file browser, click
Admin
in the left sidebar.
Select the
Settings

Next to the pinned plugin that you want to remove, click
Remove
Click
Save
to apply your changes.
Set a default language for code snippets
You can set a default language for code snippets in Dev Mode to match the language and properties used by developers when implementing designs. This helps developers save time and avoid language mix-ups.
You can set a default
language for code snippets in Dev Mode
for the entire organization. When you set a default language for code snippets, the code snippets that appear in Dev Mode’s Inspect panel will use the language you set. Additionally, specific properties may be available based on the language you set as default. For example, some languages let you also set a default unit of measure.
You can also add plugins to provide additional languages for code snippets, such as any codegen plugins that are used internally by your developers.
Setting a default language does not prevent members of your organization from manually selecting a different option when they’re inspecting a design in Dev Mode.
To set a default language for code snippets in Dev Mode:
From the file browser, click
Admin
in the left sidebar.
Select the
Settings
tab, then click
Dev Mode settings
in the
Extensions
section.
Default code language
is not yet enabled, click the toggle to enable the setting.
In the
Language
dropdown menu, select the language you want to set as default or click
Add plugin.
If you want to use a plugin to provide a default language:
Go to the listing for the plugin that you want to use to generate code snippets.
Click
Copy link
in the
Share
section to add the plugin URL to your clipboard.
Paste the plugin link in the field provided and click
Add
to confirm. Figma will add the plugin as an option for default language.
If required, configure any additional properties for the default language, such as the unit of measure.
Click
Save
to apply your changes.
Set a plugin to auto-run
Setting a Dev Mode plugin to auto-run when a file opens is a great way to implement organizational standards for all of your Dev Mode users. For example, if your teams consistently use an internal Figma plugin for development support, you can set that plugin to run automatically, ensuring all Dev Mode users have the same experience.
You can set a specific Dev Mode plugin to run automatically when a Figma file opens. The auto-run setting cannot be used for codegen plugins that provide code snippets to the inspect panel — see
Set default language for code snippets
for those plugins.
Only one plugin can be set to auto-run per organization.
To set a plugin to auto-run for the entire organization:
Go to the listing for the plugin that you want to auto-run.
Click
Copy link
in the
Share
section to add the plugin URL to your clipboard.
From the file browser, click
Admin
in the left sidebar.
Select the
Settings
tab, then click
Dev Mode settings
in the
Extensions
section.
Auto-run plugin
is not enabled, enable the setting. You should only need to do this once per organization.
Paste the plugin link in the field provided and click
Set
to confirm.
