Figma Design files have four distinct interactive areas: a toolbar, two panels, and a scrollable canvas. These areas allow you to access, create and adjust elements of your design.
In this article, we're going to cover the
Navigation panel
(left panel) which gives you access to layers and pages in your file. You can also use the left panel to view components created in the current file and access components from any libraries added to the file.
Open the Navigation panel
There are a two tabs in the Navigation panel:
File
and
Assets
. You can click to switch between each view in the panel, or use keyboard shortcuts:
Mac
File tab
⌥ Option
Assets tab
⌥ Option
Windows
File tab
Alt
Assets tab
Alt
Minimize or expand panels
Minimize
Expand
the left and right panels, click
in the left panel, or using the keyboard shortcut
Shift
If you select an object while the panels are minimized, the left panel remains minimized while the right panel expands so you can update the properties of the selected object. Once all objects are deselected, the right panel minimizes again.
Hide or show UI
Toggle visibility of the entire Figma UI to make more space to view designs. Find
Hide/Show UI
from Actions, or use the keyboard shortcut:
Mac
⌘ Command
Windows
Ctrl
Tip:
You can adjust the width of the left sidebar. This allows you to better see layer or asset names.
Hover your cursor over the right-edge of the sidebar. A bidirectional arrow will appear.
Click and drag to adjust the width of the panel.
Release to set the sidebar width.
Pages
Within a file, you can create as many pages as you need. Each page has its own canvas, where you can explore and iterate on your designs. You can even create separate
prototypes
on each page.
Create and manage pages →
View layers
Any frames, groups, or objects you add to the canvas will be visible in the
Layers
section of the
File
tab. New layers are added to the top of the list, or to the top of the group, frame, or section it is contained within. Or, just above the layer you currently have selected.
You can determine if a layer is a frame, group or a specific type of object by the icon next to it:
Frame
Group

Animated GIF or video
Figma nests any child objects within their parent group or frame. This allows you to collapse and expand layers within a group or Frame.
To collapse all expanded layers, click
Collapse layers
in the top right corner of the Layers panel. If you've already selected a layer when you collapse layers, all expanded layers collapse except for your selection.
There are many other ways to interact with layers:
Select layers, groups, and frames
Adjust the z-index with layer order
Rename layers individually or in bulk
Toggle layer visibility
Lock and unlock layers
Tip:
You can enable or disable the
Highlight layers on hover
setting. Go to

View components in the assets tab
Components
are aspects of your designs that you can reuse. These could be buttons or icons, or more complex UI elements like navigation menus or status bars.
You can find all of your components in the
Assets
tab. You can drag any component from the assets view onto the canvas to create an instance of the component.
To open the assets view, click the
Assets
tab in the left sidebar, or use the keyboard shortcut:
Mac
⌥ Option
Windows
Alt
Once you've opened the assets view, you can:
Open the
Libraries
modal.
Use the search field to find a specific component. Figma looks for components in the current file, as well as any libraries you can access.
Open
Libraries and settings
to filter through available libraries, and to switch between
Grid
and
List
views.
Browse through
All libraries
that have been added to the file.
Note:
Figma groups components in the assets view by heading. If you have many components, Figma will present them as a path:
file
page
frame
Explore a file, page, or frame by clicking on the arrow to expand it
Figma lists team or organization libraries added to the file, and enabled UI kits, in the assets view
Create an instance by dragging a component from the assets view on to the canvas
Learn how to insert components from the assets tab →
Libraries
Libraries allow you to publish styles, components, and variables from your files as a library. You can then apply styles and variables, or create instances of your components across files.
Get started with libraries →
To access your libraries from the assets view panel, click
Libraries
to open the libraries modal.
