Check out our
Getting Started with Prototyping
and
Build Prototypes with Interactions and Animations
articles.
Prototypes often require transitions between screens in a design. For some interactions, you may want to keep the user on the same screen, but show additional information.
Overlays allow you to show new content or information above the current screen in a prototype. Use overlays to prototype:
Alerts or confirmations
Interactive hamburger menus
Tooltips and additional information
On-screen keyboards
Overlay actions
In a prototype connection, an action usually takes the user from
. When the action is an overlay, Figma shows the overlay above the current screen.
Figma usually applies interaction settings to just that the connection. When you create an overlay, Figma applies those settings to the overlay itself, not the connection.
This allows you to apply those settings once and reuse that overlay across your prototype.
Tip!
You can create interactions between overlays using the
Swap overlay
action. Learn more in the
Swap between overlays
section.
Create an overlay
You create an overlay when you define the interaction of a connection. Overlays can be triggered from any object, layer, group or frame. The overlay must be inside a frame.
Click the
Prototype
tab in the right sidebar.
Hover over the object you want to start the overlay from. Click on the prototype node and drag a connection to the frame you want to become the overlay.
Now you can customize the interaction. There are three aspects of the interaction, the trigger, action and destination.
Select what kind of interaction will trigger the animation.
Select
Open overlay
from the actions.
Figma determines the
Destination
based on where the connection ends. For this interaction, you want this to be the overlay frame.
There are a few aspects of an overlay that you can customize:
Position:
The location of the overlay relative to the original frame. Choose from seven default options or set a position manually.
Close when clicking outside
: Check this setting to dismiss the overlay when a user clicks outside the overlay's dimensions.
Add background behind overlay:
Check this setting to add a background color behind the overlay and in front of the current frame. Set both the color and the opacity.
In the Animation section, customize how the overlay will appear. Select the (1) transition and any additional settings, including (2) direction, (3) easing, and (4) duration. Learn how to
build prototypes with interactions and animations
Tip!
Add GIFs to your overlays to simulate more advanced animations. GIFs show up as static images in the Editor, but playback as GIFs in
Presentation View
Swap between overlays
When working with overlays, you can choose the
Swap overlay
action. This allows you to keep the existing settings while you swap one overlay for another.
In the following example, we used
Swap overlay
to show a user interacting with our in-app help menu.
The user clicks on the help icon, which opens the first overlay (
Help menu
They select the
Get Help
option from the menu.
We replace the
Help menu
overlay with a
Chat window
overlay.
Note:
Figma doesn't record
Swap overlay
actions in a prototype's history. When you create a
Back
action from a
Swap overlay
transition, Figma will take you back to the previous screen, not the previous overlay.
Use Swap Overlay
Select the first overlay in the canvas.
Open the
Prototype
tab in the right sidebar.
In the
Trigger
field, choose the type of interaction you want to use as the trigger.
In the
Action
field, select
Swap overlay
In the
Destination
field, select the overlay you'd want to swap to.
Customize the
Animation
with transition, direction, easing, and duration settings.
Preview your overlay in
Presentation view
Note:
You can't set a different position for the new overlay. Figma places the new overlay in the same position as the original overlay.
Edit or delete an overlay
Unlike other actions, overlay settings are applied to the overlay and not the connection. This means you can update the overlay's settings in one place.
You can only edit or remove an overlay in
Prototype
mode.
Edit overlay
Identify an overlay using the blue
icon. This will appear next to the frame in the canvas.
Click the
icon to view overlay's settings in the right sidebar.
Make any changes to the overlay, as required.
Tip!
You can also access the overlay settings by clicking on a hotspot, or on an arrow from one of the connections.
Delete Overlay
There are a few ways to delete an overlay:
Click on the connection arrow and drag it to an empty part of the canvas.
Click the
icon to select the overlay, then press the
Delete
key.
Remove all connections on the current page. Right-click on a connection and select
Remove all interactions
