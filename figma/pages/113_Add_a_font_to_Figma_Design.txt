==================================================

Who can use this feature
Available on
any plan
Anyone can add a font to Figma Design
By default, Figma includes
Google fonts
and
Apple fonts
in Figma Design files. To use a different font, you can install it on your computer and access it in your Figma Design files.
Caution
: If you use your own font in a Figma Design file, anyone you share the file with can preview the font. To edit text layers using that font, they will need to install it on their computer. They may see errors related to
managing missing fonts
Follow the steps below to use your own font in Figma Design:
Prepare and download the font files
Install the font on your computer
Install the Figma font helper (browser only)
Use your font in a design file
1. Prepare and download the font files
Fonts are typically collections of OpenType (.OTF) or TrueType (.TTF) files. Each font can have several styles, and each style has its own file.
For example, using Inter Regular, Inter Bold, and Inter Extra Light requires three font files.
Tip:
If you're using a font that other people use too, make sure you have the same styles. If someone uses a font style in a file but you don't have that style on your computer, you'll get
a missing font error
Note
: Figma only supports .TTF and .OTF font files.
2. Install the font on your computer
To use a font, it must be installed in your computer’s font manager.
On Mac, the font manager is called Font Book. Apple provides guidelines for
installing and validating fonts in Font Book on Mac.
As a general rule, if you can see your font in Font Book, it’s installed on your computer.
On Windows, you can install fonts by adding font files to the
Fonts
folder.

Note
: Figma doesn't support fonts for devices running ChromeOS or Linux. Chromebook and Linux users can only use Google fonts and available Apple fonts (SF Pro and SF Compact), which are the default fonts in Figma.
3. Install the Figma font helper
Note
: If you're using the desktop app, you can skip this step. The desktop app includes the Figma font helper.
If you use Figma in your web browser, you need to install the Figma installer, otherwise known as the font helper, before you can add your own font to Figma Design files.
Download the Figma font installer
After installation, reload any open files in your browser to start using your font.
Note
: The Figma font installer, FigmaAgent, runs an HTTP and HTTPS server on
localhost
. It only allows connections from
figma.com
and isn't exposed to the public internet.
You may see events related to the FigmaAgent in your console log or when monitoring activity on your computer. The loopback address for localhost resolves to
127.0.0.1
You can always
uninstall the font helper
if you need to.
4. Use your font in a design file
To find and use your font:
From a Figma Design file, select or create a text layer.
Open the font selector in the right sidebar.
Open the filter dropdown and choose
Installed by you
