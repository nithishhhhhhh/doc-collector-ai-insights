Check your design for accessibility
Proper color contrast makes your designs more inclusive by improving readability for users with visual impairments. The built-in color contrast tool helps you quickly identify when a color combination meets accessibility guidelines—and when it doesn’t—so you can make adjustments as needed.
What do contrast ratios mean?
Contrast ratios measure the difference between two colors, ensuring text and UI elements are readable for all users. Higher ratios provide better readability, especially for users with low vision.
The
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(WCAG) provide best practices for color contrast, readability, and navigation. Following these standards helps ensure your designs are inclusive, user-friendly, and compliant with legal requirements. WCAG guidelines require:
4.5:1 for normal text
(AA compliance)
3:1 for large text
and graphics
(AA compliance)
7:1 for normal text
(AAA compliance)
Check color contrast
Click
to open the accessibility view in the color modal.
Review the contrast ratio between your foreground and background colors.
Note:
The color of your selected layer is always considered the foreground. The contrast ratio measures the luminance (brightness) difference between two colors. It ranges from
1:1 (no contrast)
21:1 (maximum contrast, black on white).
Follow accessibility guidance to see if your colors meet
WCAG level AA or AAA standards
AA:
essential accessibility for standard compliance
AAA:
highest-level accessibility for enhanced compliance
next to
AAA
indicates that your current values don’t meet accessibility standards and need to be adjusted.
Tip:
Click the
indicator to auto-correct the value to its nearest compliant color.
Click
to adjust color contrast accessibility settings. The following options are available:
Categories:
Auto (based on selected layer)
Large text
Normal text
Graphics
