The Figma for VS Code extension provides an
eas
y way for developers to access and inspect designs right from VS Code. You can navigate and inspect design files, collaborate with designers, track changes, and speed up design implementation—all without leaving your development environment.
Use the Figma for VS Code extension to:
See and respond to comments and activity in real time
Get code suggestions based on designs
Link code files to design components
You can install the
Figma for VS Code extension
from Visual Studio’s Marketplace. You’ll be prompted to sign in to your Figma account when you first open the extension in VS Code.
Open Figma designs in VS Code
There are a couple of ways to open a design file through the VS Code extension:
From Dev Mode

Code
settings
or the
Code
section of the Inspect panel.
Click on a top-level frame.
In the Inspect panel, click
Options
next to the layer name.
Select
Open in VS Code
From VS Code
Open VS Code.

Inspect Figma designs in VS Code
Explore a design file in VS Code
Figma for VS Code
extends the functionality of Dev Mode’s inspection features
and brings design files right to your text editor. When you select a design file in VS Code, you’ll see frames in the file grouped by section, status (e.g ready for development) and page. If a frame doesn’t have a parent section, or an assigned status, those won’t be visible.
Inspect a frame
Select from a grid of frames and see them individually with focus view. Search for frames and filter through results to quickly find what you’re looking for.
See which designs are ready for development
Click
Layers in the toolbar to view sections marked as Ready for development.
View code snippets
View code snippets and relevant information like modes and styles in the
Code
tab.
Choose your preferred language and unit for code snippets in the top-right of the Inspect toolbar.
Access Dev resources
Access relevant development links in the
Dev resources
tab. Click
Add Dev resources
to add a link to a code file or dev resource.
If a link has a matching implementation in your current codebase, it opens the file in VS Code instead of the browser.
Link Dev resources to layers in Dev Mode →
View component properties
If you have a component selected, you can view its properties in the
Component
tab.
Export assets
Download and export assets for a selected layer in the
Assets
tab.

Auto-complete code suggestions
The Figma for VS Code extension provides auto-complete suggestions based on the selected layer. This is helpful if you’re building components that don’t have an existing implementation in your codebase.
View comment notifications
You can view comment notifications in real time under
Notifications
in the primary sidebar. Click on a notification to view and add a comment to the design through VS Code.
