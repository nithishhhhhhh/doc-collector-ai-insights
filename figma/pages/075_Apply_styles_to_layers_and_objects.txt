==================================================

Before you start
Who can use this feature
Anyone on
Education, Professional, Organization, and Enterprise plans
can use style libraries.
Users with
can edit
access to a file can create and edit styles.
Users with
can view
access to a published file can use styles from that library in files where they can edit.
Styles allow you to define a set of properties or attributes of an object. You can create styles for colors, text, effects, and layout guides and reuse them across your designs.
Apply a style to an object
Apply any styles created in the current file, or apply
styles from a published team library
Tip:
You can use the
eyedropper tool
to sample a color style and apply it to a selected layer.
Select the object(s) you'd like to apply a style to.
In the right sidebar, click the
Apply s
tyles
Apply s
tyles and variables
icon next to the property you want to update.
From the
Libraries
tab of the menu, you will see all styles created in the current file and any
styles shared via the team library
indicated by round thumbnails. The square thumbnails are
color variables
. Figma orders styles in the style panel accordingly:
Alphabetically by team name
Alphabetically by file name
Individual styles appear in the order they were created. Learn about
grouping and reordering styles
Use the All libraries dropdown to filter your styles and variables to those created in a specific library.
Search and select the style you want to apply to the selected object(s). The style picker can be viewed as a
list or
grid.
Tip!
If you aren't able to access styles from the properties panel, they may not be shared to your team library yet. Learn more about
managing and sharing styles
Use the color picker
You can also
use the color picker
to apply colors from styles to objects. This is handy for situations when you want to:
Create a custom color that matches some of a style's properties. For example, use a color from a style at only 50% opacity.
Apply a color style to an object or layer in a place that doesnâ€™t support styles.
The
olor picker
allows you to switch between colors in the file (document colors) and from libraries added to the file. Click the On this page
dropdown to select a palette from an
added library
Caution:
When you select a style from the color picker, you are only setting the color, not applying a style.
Switch between styles
You can change the style that is applied to an object from the right sidebar.
Select the object(s) you'd like to update.
In the right sidebar, click on the style next to the relevant property.
Use the style picker to search for and select the new style.
Detach a style
When you detach a style from an object, that object will keep its existing properties. You can then make changes to those properties, as desired.
This is useful when using existing styles as the basis for future styles or iterations.
To detach a style from an object:
Select the object(s) you'd like to remove the style from.
In the right sidebar, hover over the relevant style.
Click the
detach style
icon when it appears.
You can now make any changes you want to the object, independent of the style.
Tip:
You can also edit any local style that's applied to an object by selecting the style to open the style picker, hovering over the style, and clicking
Share styles with libraries
When you
enable a library for a team
add it to an individual file
, Figma includes styles from that
library
in the style picker.
You can use any styles you have can view access to. You can only edit the style itself if you have can edit access to the original file.
