Request
Review
Merge
Manage
When you've finished making changes in your branch, you can request one or more people to review and approve the changes before merging the branch to the main file.
If you donâ€™t have edit access to the main file, you must request a merge from someone who does have edit access. Reviewers can either
Approve
the branch or
Request changes
You can request a review from anyone who has access to the main file. This can include members of the team, as well as anyone who has access to the file or project.
A reviewer can then review the changes in your branch and choose whether to approve them or suggest changes.
Request review

View reviewer feedback
Reviewers can choose to approve your branch or suggest further changes. Figma will send you a notification and email (if enabled) to let you know the review outcome.
There are three possible outcomes from a review. Figma represents these outcomes as a status next to the branch name in the Branch review window:
In review:
A gray badge shows that a branch review has been requested from another user. No changes have been suggested or approved yet.
Changes suggested
: A yellow badge indicates that the reviewer needs you to make some changes before the branch is accepted. You can open the review modal to view the suggestions.
Reviewers may have added feedback to individual layers or designs using comments. If there are comments, you'll see a
View comments
banner.
Approved:
Your changes have been approved, but the branch has not yet been merged. This usually means the reviewer does not have edit access to the main file or is waiting for other reviewers to add their reviews too before merging.
When ready, you can click
Merge branch
in the bottom right corner of the Branch review window, which will merge the branch into the main file. The branch will be archived and locked after it has been merged.
