==================================================

Before you Start
Who can use this feature
Anyone on
any plan
can use variables
Anyone with access to a file can use variables from that file
Looking for more resources on variables?
Check out our guide to variables
Apply variables to various layer properties in the right sidebar. You can also apply variables to properties in text styles and color styles. Learn about
which properties each variable type supports
You can use any variables created in the current file, or variables from any
published team library
to which you have access.
Apply a color variable
Color variables can be applied to solid fills or gradient stops for fills, stroke colors, and color styles. While shadow colors don't have gradient stops, you can still apply color variables to the shadow color.
Color variables and color styles are selected from the same
Libraries
picker.
Color variables are displayed in square swatches.
Color styles are displayed in circle swatches.
Use the search bar to search by variable name or variable group.
Open the dropdown to filter by library.
Tip:
You can apply existing variables and styles to layers using the
eyedropper tool
Solid fills
To use a color variable on a selected layer:
Click
Apply styles and variables
from the
Fill
Stroke
sections of the right panel.
Select a variable from the picker to apply.
You can also
apply color variables within a mixed selection
Learn more about fill and stroke properties
Gradient stops
Apply color variables to gradient stops of any fill or stroke property.
Select the layer, and add a fill or stroke if one doesn't exist yet.
Click the color swatch for your fill or stroke.
From the color picker, select the Gradient icon and click a color swatch from the
Stops
list.
From the new menu, open the
Libraries
tab and select a variable to apply to the gradient stop.
Repeat for any remaining gradient stops.

Shadow effects
To apply a color variable to the color property of a shadow effect:
Select the layer.
From the right panel, add a shadow effect if one doesn't yet exist.
Click the
Effect settings
icon of the inner shadow or drop shadow effect.
Click the color swatch.
Open the
Libraries
tab and select a variable to apply.
Learn more about shadow effects
Styles
Color variables can be applied to new and existing color styles as well as the color property of shadow effects.
Tip:
You can apply color variables to styles using the
eyedropper tool
Color style with solid fill
To use a variable on a solid color style:
Deselect everything on the canvas by pressing
Esc
From the right panel, edit an existing color style or create a new one.
From the menu, click a color swatch from the
Properties
section.
Open the
Libraries
tab and select a variable to apply.
Color style with gradient stops
To use variables on a gradient color style:
Deselect everything on the canvas by pressing
Esc
From the right panel, edit an existing color style or create a new one.
From the window, select the
Gradient
icon.
Under
Stops
, click a color swatch from the list.
From the new menu, open the
Libraries
tab and select a variable to apply to the gradient stop.
Repeat for any remaining gradient stops.
Effect style with a color property
To use a variable on the color of a shadow effect style:
Deselect everything on the canvas by pressing
Esc
From the right panel, edit an existing shadow style or create a new one.
Click the
Effect settings
icon of the inner shadow or drop shadow effect.
Click the color swatch.
Open the
Libraries
tab and select a variable to apply.
Apply a number variable
To apply a number variable to a selected object:
Click into the property field.
Press
to open the
Library
picker.
You can also choose one of the following methods:
Property
Additional methods
Font size
Gap between
Layout guide count
Width and height
Maximum width and height
Open the dropdown menu and select
Apply variable
Corner radius
Effects
Layout guide width, height, margin, offset, and gutter
Padding
Click
Apply variable
Hold
Shift
and click into the field
Layer opacity
Letter spacing
Line height
Paragraph indent
Paragraph spacing
Stroke weight
Hold
Shift
and click into the field
Right-click and select
Apply variable
From the
Library
picker, select a variable. Number variables are noted with a number icon.
Note:
If the methods above aren't working, it’s possible you don’t have any variables available to apply. Either create a supported variable in the file or enable a library containing a supported variable.
Apply a string variable
Text content
String variables can be applied to the text content of any text layer. This means if the string variable has the value
Figma
, then the text on canvas will display as
Figma
Select a text layer.
From the
Text
section at the top of the right sidebar, click
Apply variable
Select a variable from the
Library
picker to apply.
Tip:
You can also use number variables on text content. This can be useful for building prototypes that require calculations, such as subtotals in a shopping experience. Learn how to use
variables in prototypes
Font properties
String variables can be applied to font family or font weight and style.
To apply a string variable to a selected text layer:
Open the dropdown for font family or font weight.
Select
Apply variable
Select a variable from the picker.
To apply a string variable to a new or existing text style:
Edit or create a new text style.
From the window, open the dropdown for font family or font weight.
Select
Apply variable
Select a variable from the picker.
Apply a boolean variable
Boolean variables can be applied to layer visibility.
If the value of the boolean variable is
true
then the layer will be visible. If the value of the boolean variable is
false
then the layer will be hidden.
From the
Appearance
section of the right sidebar, right-click the
visible /
hidden icon.
Select a variable from the picker.
Apply variables to variant instances
Boolean, number, and string variables can be applied to instances with variant
properties
to switch between variants of a component set. This can help you switch between variants depending on the mode of the parent frame.
Learn how to create variable modes for variant instances
Detach a variable
To detach a variable:
For color, string, and boolean variables
: Hover over the variable in the relevant right sidebar section, and click the
Detach variable
icon.
For number variables
: Click into the property field and press
Delete
Backspace
. For certain properties, you can also click the
Detach variable
icon.
Note:
Using on-canvas controls to change an auto layout frame’s padding or gap between items will detach any applied number variables.
Paste unpublished variables across files
When you copy and paste an object from one file to another, you may want to duplicate the object's unpublished variables to the second file to continue editing variables on the pasted object—such as when you are building a prototype.
This is possible for objects that have:
Unpublished variables directly applied to their properties (such as fill color).
Or, unpublished styles directly applied to their properties, where the styles use unpublished variables. In this case, the pasted object will lose its connection to the unpublished style when opting to copy variables over.
Once you paste these objects to a different file, a toast notification is triggered at the bottom of the file. If you opt to copy the variables over, they’ll be copied into a new collection and the pasted objects will remap to the new variables.
If the object you copied is a published component and the destination file has access to it, then no remapping will occur.
Note:
Pasted objects will remap to existing variables within the second file if,
The second file contains a collection with an identical name as the collection from the first file;
And that collection in the second file also contains variables with identical names as the pasted variables
