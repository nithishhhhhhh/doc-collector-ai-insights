==================================================

Who can use this feature
Available on all
paid plans
Requires a
Full seat
with edit access to the library's source file
Publish a
library
to share common design elements—like buttons, icons, pieces of UI, colors, or values for certain properties—with the rest of your team. Other people can use these design elements in their files, which helps everyone stay consistent.
When you first create a
style,
component
, or
variable
in a file, it is only accessible from that file. To make it available in other files, you need to publish it as a
library
If you make changes to these assets or add new ones, you can publish them as updates to the library. People using the library in their files can quickly
review the changes
and automatically update their designs.
Note:
Libraries are only available on
paid plans
. You can still create components and styles on the free Starter plan, but you can't publish them in a library to access them in other files.
Publish a library
To publish a design file as a library, there needs to be at least one component, style, or variable in the file. If the file is in your drafts, you’ll need to move it to a project before publishing.
Once published, anyone with access to the library’s source file can use the library in their files.
Tip
: A library inherits its name from the source file. Make sure you give your file a clear, meaningful name that helps people understand what it’s for, like ‘Habitz design system’, ‘UI3 library’, or ‘Website design kit’.
In a file with components, styles, or variables you’d like to share, select the
Assets
tab in the left sidebar.
Click the
Libraries
icon. The tooltip may read
Review library updates
if there are updates to libraries you are using in the file, or
Review unpublished changes
if you have unpublished updates in your file.
From the
This file
section, find your current file and click
Publish
Add a description of the library's purpose, or a summary of any decisions or changes.
From the list of styles, components, or variables that have been added, modified, or removed, uncheck any assets you don't want to publish. You can also uncheck
Changes
to deselect everything.
Organization and Enterprise plans only:
Use the dropdown menu to choose
where to publish the library
Click
Publish
. A notification will appear confirming your library has been successfully published.
Tip
: If you want to make sure certain components, styles, or variables never get published, you can
hide them in the publishing flow
. Right-click on any asset in the library modal and select
Hide when publishing
. To undo, right-click it again and select
Show when publishing.
Why is the publish button not working?
If the publish button is deactivated, it might be one of the following reasons:
There are no
components
styles
, or
variables
in the file. Try creating a new one to see if the option to publish appears.
The library has no publishable changes. In this case, nothing has changed since the last time the library was published. Try editing a component, style or variable in the library. You may also need to check whether the design elements you’re editing are
hidden from publishing
Choose where to publish a library
Organization and Enterprise
Organization or Enterprise plan users can publish libraries to a specific team or the whole organization. Enterprise plan users can also publish libraries to workspaces.
This helps libraries reach the right audience. For example, you might publish a company-wide design system library to the organization, or a library with mobile app components to the specific team working on the mobile app.
If the library’s source file has sharing permissions that are too restrictive, Figma will prompt you to change them. For example, if your file is set to
Only invited people can access
and you want to publish a library to the organization, you’ll be asked to change the file’s permissions to
Everyone at your organization can access
Publish updates to a library
If you make changes to a style, component, or variable in a library’s source file, those changes will only appear in the current file until you publish them. Publishing updates to a library follows the same process as
publishing a library for the first time
Note
: Once you’ve publish updates to a library, people using the library will see a blue badge on the library icon in the left sidebar of their file. They can then
review and accept the updates
Tip:
Every time you publish updates to a library, you'll be prompted to add a description. This allows you to communicate decisions and changes to the people who use your library.
Figma shows descriptions when
accepting updates from a library
, as well as in the file's version history.
