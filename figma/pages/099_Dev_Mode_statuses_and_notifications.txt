==================================================

Before you Start
Who can use this feature
Notifications and the
Ready for dev
status are available on all paid plans
The
Completed
status is available on the
Organization and Enterprise plans
Requires a
Full or Dev seat
Statuses and notifications in Dev Mode help to manage developer handoff.
Statuses
are used to track when sections, frames, or components are ready for development.
Notifications
are based on status changes so developers can react to the state of designs.
Statuses
Dev Mode statuses show the current stage of a design for handoff. Designers can add notes to statuses about updates or changes.
There are two statuses available in Dev Mode for managing handoff:
Ready for dev
: Indicates that sections, frames, and components that are ready for a developer to review and implement.
Completed
(Organization and Enterprise plans): Indicates that development work for the design is complete.
Both the
Ready for dev
status and the
Completed
status also have a
Changed
state. The
Changed
state is set when a design that’s been marked ready for dev or completed is modified. It cannot be set manually.
When a designer updates a design previously marked ready for dev or completed, they should follow the steps to
update the status for the changed design
to clear the
Changed
state.
When a developer encounters a design that’s changed, they can
compare changes
to see why the state has changed and the differences from the previous version. The developer should also reach out to their designers to
update the status of the changed design
A design won't be marked as changed in the following instances:
If a component instance is updated from a shared library
If there’s a change in value of a variable that’s already attached to a layer in the design
If there’s a change in value of a style that’s already attached to a layer in the design
If the change is temporary, such as when hovering an object over a design that uses auto layout
Statuses, including updating a status that’s changed, can be set while editing designs or in Dev Mode. You can also change and update statuses in Dev Mode
ready for dev view
and
focus view
Mark a design as ready for dev

In Figma Design or Dev Mode, select a section, frame, or component.
For sections and frames, next to the label, click

notified
that the design is marked
Ready for dev

Optionally, in the text box that appears, type a reason for the change. The reason is included in the version history for the design and
notifications
triggered by the change.

. Any users that previously opened the file are notified that the design has been updated. If you wrote a reason for the change, that reason is included in the notification.
Notifications
Dev Mode notifications keep you informed when statuses change in a file. Figma supports email, desktop, and mobile push notifications by default. You can also set up:
Slack notifications with the
Slack integration for Figma
Teams notifications with the
Figma app for Microsoft Teams
If you’ve viewed a file in Dev Mode and have either a full or dev seat, you’ll receive notifications when designs are first marked as
Ready for dev
If you have an Organization or Enterprise plan, additional notifications are triggered:
For designs that were previously
Ready for dev
Completed
, when the status is
updated following a change
to the design.
When a design is
marked Completed
If multiple designs change status within an hour, the notifications are grouped by type. For instance, several
Ready for dev
updates will be combined into a single notification.
Dev Mode notifications include links to the relevant designs:
The
Inspect in Dev Mode
link goes to the
ready for dev view
for the corresponding Figma file
The individual cards for designs open the corresponding design in
focus view
Manage Dev Mode notifications

Click the Dev Mode toggle or use the keyboard shortcut

at the top of the right sidebar.
