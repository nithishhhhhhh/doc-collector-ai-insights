==================================================

Before you start
Who can use this feature
Anyone on any plan can create styles. To publish styles to libraries, you'll need to be on an
Education, Professional, Organization, or Enterprise plan
Anyone with
can edit
access to a file can create and edit styles.
Anyone with
can view
access to a published file can use styles from that library in files they can edit.
Styles allow you to define a set of properties or attributes and reuse them across your designs. You can create styles for colors, text, effects, and layout guides.
View styles
View styles available to you in this file from the style picker, or view styles that live in the file from the right sidebar when nothing is selected. Styles living in a file are do not include styles from other libraries that are in use.
To view styles from other published files, you can view them in the style picker for a selected property if the style's library is enabled. Learn more about
enabling libraries in a file
Right sidebar
Once you have created at least one style within a file, you can view a list of styles living in the file from the right sidebar:
From the file, navigate to the
Design
panel in the right sidebar.
Deselect everything on the canvas:
Click on an empty spot in the canvas
Press
Esc
to deselect your current selection
From there, view styles living in the file from the
Styles
section.
Style picker
View styles from the current file and styles from other libraries from the style picker.
Click the
styles icon next to the relevant property in the right sidebar. Figma will open the style picker which lets you to view any styles available for that property.
The default order for styles in the style panel is:
Alphabetically by team name
Alphabetically by file name
Individual styles are in the same order as they appear in the right sidebar
You can toggle between
list and
grid views.
Manage styles
To make changes to a style, you will need to edit the style definition in its original file. It's not possible to make changes to the style from another file.
Group styles
To make finding and selecting styles easier, you can organize your styles into groups. This can be done by using the
naming convention and by creating folders.
Group by folder
You can group styles by creating folders from the
Design
tab of the right sidebar. Folders will be reflected from the
Local styles
section of the right sidebar and in the style picker when you click
for a given property.
To create a folder:
Select one or more styles:
Press
Shift
and click to select a range styles
Press
⌘ Command
Control
and click to select multiple non-adjacent styles.
Right-click the selected style(s) and click
Add new folder
Name the new folder and press
Return
Enter
to save.
Once created, the styles in the folder will be renamed according to their new heirarchy within the styles list. For example, if we have a style
Brand / Fuchsia
that was moved to the
Blog
folder within the
Brand
folder, it'll be renamed to
Brand / Blog / Fuchsia
To delete a folder and the styles in it, right-click the folder name and select
Delete.
You can also move all styles to another location to keep the styles and delete the folder.
Group by name
Grouping styles using the slash naming convention involves adding a prefix to your style names so Figma groups them under the same heading.
In the example below, we use the slash naming convention to name and organize our styles:
Blog/color
Brand Style Guide/Color
Secondary/Color
Tip
Styles appear in the styles panel in the order they appear in the
Local styles
list. To change the order your styles appear, you can update by clicking and dragging them in the
Local styles
list from the file in which they were created.
Reorder and move styles
When you view the
Styles
section in the right sidebar, you can see every style in the current file, grouped by the style type: text, color, effect, and layout guides.
By default, Figma will show styles in the order they were added. To make them easier to find and navigate, you can change the order or folder in which they appear.
Select one or more styles:
Press and hold
Shift
and click to select a range styles.
Press and hold
⌘ Command
Control
and click to select multiple non-adjacent styles.
Drag the style to change the order or move them to a new folder.
Moving a style from one folder to another changes the name for the style to reflect its place in the hierarchy. For example, moving the color style
Brand Style Guide / blue
to the
Blog
folder will also change the style name to
Blog / blue
Note:
You can only adjust the order for styles that live in the current file you're in, Figma sorts styles in the style picker differently.

Publish library changes
When you move published styles between files, Figma prompts you to publish your changes to any affected libraries.
You must publish these changes to complete the move process. Figma pushes updates to all subscribed files when you publish your changes.
Click
Publish
in the notification window, or use the shortcut to open the library modal:
Mac:
⌥ Option
Windows:
Alt
Add a description of your changes. Figma shows this in the file’s version history.
Click
Publish.
Figma pushes updates to any file that uses those styles. You'll see the usual bell notification and a prompt to receive updates from the library. Learn how to
review and accept updates from libraries
Reverse or undo a style move
It's not possible to undo the action of moving styles using any of these methods:
❌ Using the undo keyboard shortcut
❌ Restoring an earlier version of either file
To reverse a style move, we recommend repeating the method outlined in the previous sections to move the style back to its original file. Be sure to publish and accept the changes afterwards.
Duplicate styles
To save time when creating styles for your design system, you can duplicate existing styles instead of creating new ones each time.
To duplicate a style:
Click an empty spot on the canvas to de-select all layers.
Locate the style you plan to duplicate under the Styles section in the right sidebar.
Right-click the style and select
Duplicate style
from the dropdown menu.
The duplicated style will appear in the Styles list directly below your selection.

Press and hold
⌘ Command

and click to select multiple non-adjacent styles.
Select
Delete style
from the options.
Figma will remove the style and you will no longer be able to use it. Any objects using that style will keep their properties, but are detached from the style.
Share styles
To access your styles in other files and projects, you can publish them to a
team library
. You can publish styles on their own, or alongside any components.
Note:
Publishing assets—styles, components, and variables—to team libraries is available on
paid plans

Publish
to share them as a library.
When you publish changes to a library, Figma will prompt anyone using this library to receive updates. This makes sure any layers that use these styles use the most recent version.
Use styles from a library

can edit
access to that file can access those styles and components.
View any style from that library in the style picker.
