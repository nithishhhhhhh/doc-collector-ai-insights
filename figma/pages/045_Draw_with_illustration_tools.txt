Anyone with
can edit
access to a file can use the Pencil and Brush tools
The Pencil and Brush tools allow you to draw and paint directly inside a Figma Design file. Use the Pencil tool for quick sketches, notes, and line work, then enhance your creations with the Brush tool to add texture and color for a more organic, hand-painted appearance. You can access the Pencil and Brush tools while in
Figma Draw
Drawing with the Pencil and Brush tools i
nvolves creating
vector
networks
. Unlike the precise point-by-point creation process when using the
Pen tool
, the Pencil and Brush tools automatically place vector points along the path you draw. The number of points created is determined by the length and complexity of the path. You can adjust these vector points at any time in
vector edit mode
Draw with the Pencil or Brush tool
In Figma Design, click
Draw
in the toolbar to open Figma Draw.
Select the
Pencil
Brush
tool from the toolbar.
Use the secondary toolbar to set the strokeâ€™s color, size, and style.
Click and drag your cursor to begin drawing. To draw a straight line, hold
Shift
as you move your cursor.
Note:
You can also apply brush styles to existing strokes in your designs. Learn more about
adjusting stroke properties
Create custom brush styles
You can personalize your design toolkit by creating your own custom brush styles. Custom brush styles can be created from any single vector layer, such as a shape, a custom vector path, or a
flattened text layer
Note:
Only closed vector paths can be used as a source for custom brushes. If you have an open vector path, such as a stroke from the Brush or Pencil tool, you can use
Outline stroke
to convert the stroke into a closed vector path.
To create a custom brush:
Right-click on a vector layer.
Hover over
Create brush
, then select
Stretch brush
. This will elongate the brush style along the length of the stroke.
Once created, you can access the brush from the Brush styles menu or the
Advanced stroke settings
Access custom brushes in other files
By default, custom brushes are only available in the file where they were created. To access a custom brush in another file, copy and paste a layer that uses the brush style into the new file. The brush will be automatically added to the brush styles menu and remain available even if you delete the layer you initially copied.
