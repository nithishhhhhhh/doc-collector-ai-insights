==================================================

Who can use this feature
Available on
all plans
If you’re new to Figma, we recommend our
guide to exploring design files
At Config 2024, we introduced a redesigned Figma, called UI3. This guide was created to help you switch over to the new designs and see how things have changed.
Why we redesigned Figma
Figma has grown more complex over time, and UI3 is an effort to simplify your design experience. Our intent is to make Figma Design feel more focused for designers and more approachable for a broad range of people. We’re also creating a consistent foundation for our existing products—and products yet to come.
This new design:
Gives you more control over the interface, with resizable and collapsible panels
Draws more emphasis to your work on the canvas
Makes features more intuitive by improving their placement, grouping, and how they adapt to different contexts
Adds consistency with our other products, making it easier to switch between Figma Design, FigJam, Dev Mode, and Figma Slides

What's changed
Navigation panel
We’ve reorganized the navigation panel on the left side of the canvas to house all the information about your file and make it easier to use.
Minimize the UI
If you need a bit more room on the canvas, you can now minimize the UI from the navigation panel. Click
Minimize UI
to collapse both the navigation panel and
properties panel
If you select something on the canvas with the UI minimized, the properties panel temporarily opens back up so you can access each property’s controls.
File name and location
Click the
dropdown icon next to the file name to take action on a file, like
moving it
publishing a library
, creating a
branch
, or showing the
version history
Assets tab
We’ve made it easier to
search, browse, and insert components
from the
Assets
tab.
Toolbar
The
new toolbar
moves design tools to the bottom of the editor. This frees up more working space on the canvas and introduces brand new AI capabilities via the new actions menu.
Note
: The AI features in Figma Design are rolling out over the coming months.

Actions
Actions
is a brand new item in the toolbar, and is all about helping you go from imagination to reality, faster. From here, you can access all Figma’s AI tools, common productivity actions, plugins and widgets, components, and more.
Enter Dev Mode
You can now access
Dev Mode
in the toolbar, making it easier to switch between modes in Figma Design.
Properties panel
The
Design
view of the properties panel is easier to use and properties are now grouped to match more modern workflows.
You can also resize the properties panel, which is handy for working with components with long names.
Property labels
New to UI3, you can now turn on
Property labels
to make it clearer what each property does.
To turn on property labels, click the
dropdown menu next to the 100% zoom percentage in the properties panel and select
Property labels
Selection actions
The properties panel now features a header row with actions you can perform on a selected object.
For example, you might find the buttons to apply a
mask
, create a
component
, or perform a boolean operation—or they might be tucked away in the
More
menu.
Layout
Layout
contains all the properties related to an object’s layout, like width and height.
When you click
Use auto layout
on a frame, the
Layout
label changes to
Auto layout
, and all the auto layout properties become available.
Position
You can now access all properties related to an object’s position on the canvas, including constraints, under
Position
Tip
: You can now
spotlight
yourself from the properties panel. When people enter spotlight, we’ll minimize the left and right panels, and the toolbar, so you have more room to show off your work.
Where did a feature move to?
Take a look at the list below to see everything that’s moved—and where you can find it.

Ask for edit access
If you have
can view
access to a file and would like to edit it, you can request edit access by clicking
Ask to edit
in the toolbar.
Absolute position
Absolute position
is now
Ignore auto layout.
When you ignore auto layout, you can manually position an object inside an auto layout frame without following the auto layout structure.
To ignore auto layout, select a child of an auto layout frame, then click
in the properties panel.
Align objects
The
alignment controls
help you align an object to its parent layer, or align multiple objects to one another.
Select more than one object, then click one of the alignment tools under
Position
in the properties panel.
Auto layout
When you use
auto layout
on a frame, it will adjust dynamically to content changes and different screen sizes.
To use auto layout on a frame, click
in the
Layout
section of the properties panel.
Blend modes
Blend modes
define how you want two layers to blend together.
To apply a blend mode, select an object, click
next to
Appearance
, then select a mode.
Clip content
Clip content allows you to hide parts of a layer that extend beyond the bounds of the parent frame.
Use the
Clip content
checkbox under
Layout
to choose whether to clip or show content.
Component properties
Component properties
are the changeable aspects of a component. You can define which parts of a component others can change by tying them to specific properties.
If a component has component properties available, you can find them underneath the name of the frame in the properties panel.
Constraints
Constraints
tell Figma how layers should behave when you resize their parent frames.
With a child layer selected, the
Constraints
icon will appear next to the X and Y position values in the
Position
section of the properties panel.
Corner radius
Corner radius
is a property that allows you to round the corners of an object.
With an object selected, click the
corner radius field under
Appearance
and change the value.
You can also click
to modify each corner individually.
File name, project name, and file actions
The name of a file, its project, and the file actions dropdown have moved to the navigation panel.
Go to main component
You can navigate to the main component of an instance directly from the properties panel.
Mask
Use a
mask
to show specific areas of an object while concealing the rest.
With an object selected, click
Use as mask
to create a mask group with the object as a mask. Depending on the number of available actions,
Use as mask
might be in the
More
menu.
Multi-edit
Multi-edit
lets you select multiple layers across frames, groups, and sections and apply the same edits to them in bulk.
Click
in the properties panel to enable multi-edit.
Plugins and widgets

plugins
and
widgets
, open
Actions
from the toolbar, then click the

Variable modes
Variable modes
represent the different contexts of a design. A mode contains a list of values for
a variable within a collection
If a variable collection has multiple modes, then you can switch modes on layers and elements to quickly change designs for different contexts.
As long as an object is bound to a variable with multiple modes, you can click
next to
Appearance
to switch the variable mode.
Add variant
Variants
allow you to group and organize similar components into a single container. When you insert a component instance, you can switch between the variant properties of the component set.
To add a variant, select a main component, then click
Add a variant
next to the component name in the properties panel.
Edit a vector path
