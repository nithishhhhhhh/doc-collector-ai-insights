==================================================

Before you Start
Who can use this feature
Available on
any plan
Anyone can import Sketch files to their drafts
Anyone with
can edit
access to a team can import Sketch files to that team
You can import Sketch files (.sketch) into Figma. When you import a file, it is converted to a Figma Design file and any further changes made to the original file in Sketch will not be reflected in Figma.
Note
If you’re using a beta version of Sketch, there may be discrepancies with how assets are imported into Figma. We recommend saving files using the latest version of Sketch before importing them to Figma.
If you only want to import individual assets from Sketch, you can also copy and paste the asset into a design file. Learn more about
copying assets between design tools →
How Sketch features are converted in Figma
After importing a Sketch file, you’ll notice that existing Sketch features will have been converted to Figma features.

Artboards
Any artboards in the Sketch file will be converted to frames in Figma. Like artboards, frames are used to contain content but include some additional functionality. Learn more about
working with frames →
Pages
Like Sketch, Figma supports having multiple pages within a single design file. Any page that exists in your Sketch file will be imported as a separate page within the design file.
You can navigate between pages using the Layers panel in the left sidebar. Learn more about
using the Layers panel →
Symbols and libraries
When you import a Sketch file into Figma, any symbols included in the original file are converted to components in Figma. The Symbols page in the Sketch file will be imported into Figma as a page named “Symbols” that contains your main components. Learn more about
working with components →
When you import a symbol library from Sketch, it is imported as a design file, not a library. If you’re on a paid plan, you can publish the components to a library after importing. This allows you to use the components across multiple design files. Learn more about
publishing libraries →
Note:
If you a import Sketch file that includes symbol instances, you’ll need to reconnect those instances to the main component after publishing the symbols to a library. You can do this either by
swapping individual components
or by
performing a library swap
Fonts
If your Sketch file uses fonts stored on your computer, you will need to make those fonts available in Figma. If you’re using the
Figma desktop app
, these fonts are accessible by default. If you’re using Figma in the browser, you’ll need to download the
Figma font installer
to access them. Learn more about
accessing fonts on your computer →
If you receive a “Missing fonts” error message after importing a Sketch file, you’ll be prompted to update any affected text layers. Learn more about
managing missing fonts →
Note:
Figma does not support fonts installed on devices running ChromeOS or Linux. Organization admins can upload custom fonts for members of the organization to use. Learn more about
uploading custom fonts to an organization →
Styles
Styles are not retained during the import process. You will need to recreate any styles you used in Sketch after the file has been imported. Learn more about
creating styles →
Import a Sketch file
You can import a Sketch file using the file browser or the editor.
Note:
Attempting to import very large Sketch files may result in a failed import. To prevent this, consider splitting up the Sketch file into smaller files before importing.
