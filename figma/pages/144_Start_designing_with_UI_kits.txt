==================================================

Before you Start
Who can use this feature
Available in Figma Design files on
all plans
Anyone with

access
UI kits are a set of libraries curated by Figma and partners, optionally available from the assets tab in Figma Design files.
UI kits contain high-quality components, styles, variables, and example screens to kick-start your designs, even if you don’t have a design system of your own. They behave just like any other library in Figma, in that you can pull assets onto your canvas directly from the assets tab.
There are three UI kits available:
iOS and iPadOS 18
by Apple*
Material 3 Design Kit
by Google
Simple Design System
by Figma
Unlike other Community resources, updates to UI kits are automatically available in your design files where you have the option to accept the updates.
Each UI kit also supports Code Connect for those on Professional, Organization, and Enterprise plans, so you can grab code to assets at any time.
*Before you use Apple's UI kit
Apple requires users to accept an end user licensing agreement (EULA) before using their kit.

Find and use UI kits
UI kits are automatically enabled on Starter teams. They are optionally available for Professional, Organization, and Enterprise plans.
Admins may toggle access to UI kits
for their team or organization.
From the Assets tab
You can access UI kits from the
Assets
tab in the left panel/sidebar of a design file. How you access UI kits depends on your plan:
Starter
Professional, Organization, and Enterprise
UI kits are enabled on all design files in a Starter team. From the file, UI kits are listed at the top of the libraries list in the
Assets
tab. Double-click a UI kit to open it to browse through the available assets.
For design files within Professional teams and organizations, UI kits can be added to individual files:
Select the
Assets
tab in the left sidebar.
Click
Libraries
to open the
Libraries
modal. The tooltip may read
Review library updates
if there are updates to libraries you are using in the file, or
Review unpublished changes
if you have unpublished updates in your file.
Select
UI kits
in the sidebar.
Click
Add to file
next to the UI kit you want to enable in the file. To remove from the file, click
Remove
Once UI kits are added to a file, you can access them in the Assets tab at the bottom of the list of libraries.
If you don’t see UI kits in the Assets tab, make sure you have
can edit
access to the file and that
UI kits are enabled
by your team or organization admin.
Once you’ve accessed the UI kit, you can use it like you would any Figma library, such as inserting components onto the canvas, swapping instances, and customizing component variants before inserting.
From the Community
UI kits can also be accessed in the
Figma Community
Open the Community page for the UI kit that you want to use.
Click
Open in Figma
From the prompt window, choose
Show kit in Figma
If you belong to one or more team or organization, you’ll be asked to choose a space to create a new draft.
Make a copy
You can make a copy of a UI kit to edit its assets or browse the design system.
Open the UI kit’s Community page.
Click
Open in Figma.
From the prompt window, choose
Make a new copy
In the next prompt, choose the team or organization you want the copy to live in.
Once you choose a team or organization, a copy of the kit will be added to the draft folder of that space.
Receive updates
Note:
Copies of UI kits will not receive updates from the creators if there are updates to the library. If you want to use assets from the kit and receive updates to them, use assets directly from the UI kit.
Updates to UI kits are managed by the UI kit authors. If an author publishes updates to their UI kit, you’ll have the option to accept the updates from within individual design files.
To view and accept updates to a UI kit, check the
Library updates
modal from any design file.
Manage access to UI kits (admins only)
Admins can control the level of access to UI kits for their team or organization in two different ways:
global setting
to enable or disable the UI kit feature for an entire team or organization (paid plans only)
Individual settings to
toggle specific UI kits
on or off for a team
Toggle UI kits globally
If you’re a team admin for a Professional team or admin for an organization, you can toggle the UI kits feature globally for your entire team or organization.
When the UI kits feature is disabled globally, you won't be able to add individual UI kits to files and their assets won't be discoverable. However, team members can still
make a copy of UI kits
from the Community and use the assets from the duplicated file.
Open your team or organization space in the file browser.
Click
Admin
from the left sidebar.
Open the
Settings
tab, and go to
Resources
UI kit
Use the toggle to enable or disable the UI kits feature. This setting applies to all files within the team or organization.
Toggle individual UI kits for a team
Team admins can toggle individual UI kits from their team’s default libraries settings. These settings apply to all files within the team by default.
When an individual UI kit is disabled, assets from the UI kit are still discoverable and team members can still
add the UI kit to a file
for use.
If your team is part of an organization or is on a Professional plan, UI kits will need to be
enabled globally
in order for to access individual settings.
Open your team in the file browser.
Open the dropdown next to the team name and click
View settings
From the settings modal, go to click
View team libraries
Open the
UI kits
tab.
Use the dropdowns next to the UI kit’s name to turn it on or off. These settings apply to all files within that team.
