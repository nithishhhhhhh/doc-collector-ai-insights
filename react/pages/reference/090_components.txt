# Built-in React Components
# Built-in React Components
React exposes a few built-in components that you can use in your JSX.
## Built-in components
- <Fragment>, alternatively written as <>...</>, lets you group multiple JSX nodes together.
- <Profiler> lets you measure rendering performance of a React tree programmatically.
- <Suspense> lets you display a fallback while the child components are loading.
- <StrictMode> enables extra development-only checks that help you find bugs early.
## Your own components
You can also define your own components as JavaScript functions.
