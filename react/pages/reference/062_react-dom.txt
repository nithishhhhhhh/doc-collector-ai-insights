# React DOM APIs
# React DOM APIs
The react-dom package contains methods that are only supported for the web applications (which run in the browser DOM environment). They are not supported for React Native.
## APIs
These APIs can be imported from your components. They are rarely used:
- createPortal lets you render child components in a different part of the DOM tree.
- flushSync lets you force React to flush a state update and update the DOM synchronously.
## Resource Preloading APIs
These APIs can be used to make apps faster by pre-loading resources such as scripts, stylesheets, and fonts as soon as you know you need them, for example before navigating to another page where the resources will be used.
React-based frameworks frequently handle resource loading for you, so you might not have to call these APIs yourself. Consult your framework’s documentation for details.
- prefetchDNS lets you prefetch the IP address of a DNS domain name that you expect to connect to.
- preconnect lets you connect to a server you expect to request resources from, even if you don’t know what resources you’ll need yet.
- preload lets you fetch a stylesheet, font, image, or external script that you expect to use.
- preloadModule lets you fetch an ESM module that you expect to use.
- preinit lets you fetch and evaluate an external script or fetch and insert a stylesheet.
- preinitModule lets you fetch and evaluate an ESM module.
## Entry points
The react-dom package provides two additional entry points:
- react-dom/client contains APIs to render React components on the client (in the browser).
- react-dom/server contains APIs to render React components on the server.
## Removed APIs
These APIs were removed in React 19:
- findDOMNode: see alternatives.
- hydrate: use hydrateRoot instead.
- render: use createRoot instead.
- unmountComponentAtNode: use root.unmount() instead.
- renderToNodeStream: use react-dom/server APIs instead.
- renderToStaticNodeStream: use react-dom/server APIs instead.
