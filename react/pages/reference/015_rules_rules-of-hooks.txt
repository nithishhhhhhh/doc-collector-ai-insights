# Rules of Hooks
# Rules of Hooks
Hooks are defined using JavaScript functions, but they represent a special type of reusable UI logic with restrictions on where they can be called.
- Only call Hooks at the top level
- Only call Hooks from React functions
## Only call Hooks at the top level
Functions whose names start with use are called Hooks in React.
Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, nested functions, or try/catch/finally blocks. Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function, before any early returns. You can only call Hooks while React is rendering a function component:
- ✅ Call them at the top level in the body of a function component.
- ✅ Call them at the top level in the body of a custom Hook.

It’s not supported to call Hooks (functions starting with use) in any other cases, for example:
- 🔴 Do not call Hooks inside conditions or loops.
- 🔴 Do not call Hooks after a conditional return statement.
- 🔴 Do not call Hooks in event handlers.
- 🔴 Do not call Hooks in class components.
- 🔴 Do not call Hooks inside functions passed to useMemo, useReducer, or useEffect.
- 🔴 Do not call Hooks inside try/catch/finally blocks.
If you break these rules, you might see this error.

You can use the eslint-plugin-react-hooks plugin to catch these mistakes.
### Note
Custom Hooks may call other Hooks (that’s their whole purpose). This works because custom Hooks are also supposed to only be called while a function component is rendering.
## Only call Hooks from React functions
Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. Instead, you can:
✅ Call Hooks from React function components.
✅ Call Hooks from custom Hooks.
By following this rule, you ensure that all stateful logic in a component is clearly visible from its source code.
