## Reference
### prefetchDNS(href)
To look up a host, call the prefetchDNS function from react-dom.
``````
See more examples below.
The prefetchDNS function provides the browser with a hint that it should look up the IP address of a given server. If the browser chooses to do so, this can speed up the loading of resources from that server.
#### Parameters
- href: a string. The URL of the server you want to connect to.
#### Returns
prefetchDNS returns nothing.
#### Caveats
- Multiple calls to prefetchDNS with the same server have the same effect as a single call.
- In the browser, you can call prefetchDNS in any situation: while rendering a component, in an Effect, in an event handler, and so on.
- In server-side rendering or when rendering Server Components, prefetchDNS only has an effect if you call it while rendering a component or in an async context originating from rendering a component. Any other calls will be ignored.
- If you know the specific resources you’ll need, you can call other functions instead that will start loading the resources right away.
- There is no benefit to prefetching the same server the webpage itself is hosted from because it’s already been looked up by the time the hint would be given.
- Compared with preconnect, prefetchDNS may be better if you are speculatively connecting to a large number of domains, in which case the overhead of preconnections might outweigh the benefit.
## Usage
### Prefetching DNS when rendering
Call prefetchDNS when rendering a component if you know that its children will load external resources from that host.
``````
### Prefetching DNS in an event handler
Call prefetchDNS in an event handler before transitioning to a page or state where external resources will be needed. This gets the process started earlier than if you call it during the rendering of the new page or state.
