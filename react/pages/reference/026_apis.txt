In addition to Hooks and Components, the react package exports a few other APIs that are useful for defining components. This page lists all the remaining modern React APIs.
- createContext lets you define and provide context to the child components. Used with useContext.
- lazy lets you defer loading a component’s code until it’s rendered for the first time.
- memo lets your component skip re-renders with same props. Used with useMemo and useCallback.
- startTransition lets you mark a state update as non-urgent. Similar to useTransition.
- act lets you wrap renders and interactions in tests to ensure updates have processed before making assertions.
