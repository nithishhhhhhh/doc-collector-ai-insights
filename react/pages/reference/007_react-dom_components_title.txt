## Reference
### <title>
To specify the title of the document, render the built-in browser <title> component. You can render <title> from any component and React will always place the corresponding DOM element in the document head.

See more examples below.
#### Props
<title> supports all common element props.
- children: <title> accepts only text as a child. This text will become the title of the document. You can also pass your own components as long as they only render text.
#### Special rendering behavior
React will always place the DOM element corresponding to the <title> component within the document’s <head>, regardless of where in the React tree it is rendered. The <head> is the only valid place for <title> to exist within the DOM, yet it’s convenient and keeps things composable if a component representing a specific page can render its <title> itself.
There are two exception to this:
- If <title> is within an <svg> component, then there is no special behavior, because in this context it doesn’t represent the document’s title but rather is an accessibility annotation for that SVG graphic.
- If the <title> has an itemProp prop, there is no special behavior, because in this case it doesn’t represent the document’s title but rather metadata about a specific part of the page.
### Pitfall
Only render a single <title> at a time. If more than one component renders a <title> tag at the same time, React will place all of those titles in the document head. When this happens, the behavior of browsers and search engines is undefined.
## Usage
### Set the document title
Render the <title> component from any component with text as its children. React will put a <title> DOM node in the document <head>.
``````
### Use variables in the title
The children of the <title> component must be a single string of text. (Or a single number or a single object with a toString method.) It might not be obvious, but using JSX curly braces like this:
``````
… actually causes the <title> component to get a two-element array as its children (the string "Results page" and the value of pageNumber). This will cause an error. Instead, use string interpolation to pass <title> a single string:
