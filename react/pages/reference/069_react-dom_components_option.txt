## Reference
### <option>
The built-in browser <option> component lets you render an option inside a <select> box.
``````
See more examples below.
#### Props
<option> supports all common element props.
Additionally, <option> supports these props:
- disabled: A boolean. If true, the option will not be selectable and will appear dimmed.
- label: A string. Specifies the meaning of the option. If not specified, the text inside the option is used.
- value: The value to be used when submitting the parent <select> in a form if this option is selected.
#### Caveats
- React does not support the selected attribute on <option>. Instead, pass this optionâ€™s value to the parent <select defaultValue> for an uncontrolled select box, or <select value> for a controlled select.
## Usage
### Displaying a select box with options
Render a <select> with a list of <option> components inside to display a select box. Give each <option> a value representing the data to be submitted with the form.
