See more examples below.
#### Props
<progress> supports all common element props.
Additionally, <progress> supports these props:
- max: A number. Specifies the maximum value. Defaults to 1.
- value: A number between 0 and max, or null for indeterminate progress. Specifies how much was done.
## Usage
### Controlling a progress indicator
To display a progress indicator, render a <progress> component. You can pass a number value between 0 and the max value you specify. If you donâ€™t pass a max value, it will assumed to be 1 by default.
If the operation is not ongoing, pass value={null} to put the progress indicator into an indeterminate state.
